## Understanding the Need for On-Device AI

Traditionally, accessing advanced AI capabilities required sending data to cloud servers, introducing latency, connectivity requirements, and potential privacy concerns. While cloud-based AI offers significant computational power, many everyday scenarios benefit from instant, offline, and private AI processing directly on the device.

The conventional approach involves a trade-off: either use cloud AI with its associated latency and connectivity requirements, or deploy significantly reduced AI capabilities locally. The Mu model challenges this paradigm by bringing meaningful AI capabilities directly to Windows devices.

## The Challenge of On-Device AI Deployment

Deploying AI models on consumer devices presents several fundamental challenges:

- **Hardware Constraints**: Consumer devices have limited computational resources compared to cloud servers.
