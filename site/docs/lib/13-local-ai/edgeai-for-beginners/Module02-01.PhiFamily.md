## Practical Examples and Use Cases

Before diving into the technical evolution, let's explore some concrete examples of what Phi models can accomplish:

### Mathematical Reasoning Example

Phi-4-mini-reasoning excels at step-by-step mathematical problem solving. For example, when asked "How to solve 3*x^2+4*x+5=1?", the model provides detailed reasoning steps:

```
<|system|>Your name is Phi, an AI math expert developed by Microsoft.<|end|>
<|user|>How to solve 3*x^2+4*x+5=1?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
I need to solve the quadratic equation 3x² + 4x + 5 = 1.

First, let me rearrange this to standard form:
3x² + 4x + 5 = 1
3x² + 4x + 5 - 1 = 0  
3x² + 4x + 4 = 0

Now I can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
Where a = 3, b = 4, c = 4

Let me calculate the discriminant:
b² - 4ac = 4² - 4(3)(4) = 16 - 48 = -32

Since the discriminant is negative (-32), this equation has no real solutions.
The solutions are complex: x = (-4 ± √(-32)) / 6 = (-4 ± 4i√2) / 6 = (-2 ± 2i√2) / 3
```

### Multilingual Support Example

Phi-3.5-mini-instruct demonstrates strong multilingual capabilities across various languages. Here's an example prompt format:

```
<|system|>You are a helpful assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>How to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Imagine, good sir knight, a vast network of invisible roads that span the entire realm and beyond. The Internet is like a magical system of messenger birds that can carry any message - be it text, images, or even moving pictures - instantly to any castle, village, or hamlet in the world.

Think of it as if every scribe's work could be copied and shared with thousands of people simultaneously, as if you could visit any library in any kingdom without leaving your chambers, or as if you could hold council with knights from distant lands as if they were sitting at your very table.

This "Internet" allows people to:
- Send messages faster than the swiftest horse
- Access knowledge from scholars across all kingdoms
- Trade goods without traveling to distant markets
- Share stories and news from lands you've never seen

'Tis like having a thousand scribes, merchants, and storytellers all working for you at once, good knight!
```

### Multimodal Capabilities Example

Phi-4-multimodal can process text, images, and speech simultaneously. Here are some practical applications:

**Travel Planning with Audio Input:**

**Mathematical Problem Solving from Images:**
See how Phi-4 Multimodal tackles complex mathematical problems through visual inputs, demonstrating its ability to process and solve equations presented in images.

**Function Calling Example:**
With function calling, Phi-4-mini and Phi-4-multimodal can extend their text-processing capabilities by integrating search engines, connecting various tools, and more. As illustrated, the model can retrieve Premier League match information via Phi-4-mini, showcasing its ability to interact with external data sources seamlessly.

### Code Generation Example

Phi-4-multimodal can generate structured project code based on both image content and provided prompts, as shown in this practical workflow:

1. Upload an image of a wireframe or design
2. Provide context about the project requirements
3. The model generates complete, functional code structures
4. Code can be customized based on specific frameworks or languages

### Edge Deployment Example
