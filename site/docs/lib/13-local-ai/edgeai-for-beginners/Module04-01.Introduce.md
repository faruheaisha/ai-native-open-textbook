## Understanding Model Quantization Boundaries and Classifications

Model quantization is a technique designed to reduce the precision of neural network parameters with significantly fewer bits than their full-precision counterparts. While full-precision models use 32-bit floating-point representations, quantized models are specifically designed for efficiency and edge deployment.

The precision classification framework helps us understand the different categories of quantization levels and their appropriate use cases. This classification is crucial for selecting the right precision level for specific edge computing scenarios.

### Precision Classification Framework

Understanding the precision boundaries helps in selecting appropriate quantization levels for different edge computing scenarios:

- **📱 Low Precision**: 3-bit to 4-bit quantization (balanced performance and efficiency)
- **⚖️ Medium Precision**: 5-bit to 8-bit quantization (approaching full-precision capabilities while maintaining efficiency)

The exact boundary remains fluid in the research community, but most practitioners consider 8-bit and below as "quantized," with some sources setting specialized thresholds for different hardware targets.
