# Claude Code System Prompts

What happens when this entry's helper fails at startup (bad path, missing file or interpreter, non-zero exit, timeout, oversize or invalid output) and no static settings payload (this entry's own, the linux entry's on WSL, or the map's "default") applies in its place: 'refuse' — Claude Code does not start, naming the failure; 'continue' — Claude Code starts without the helper's output, on the delivering source's own settings, with a /status notice. Default: 'refuse' when the entry comes from MDM or the managed settings file, 'continue' when it comes from remote managed settings. Any other value is treated as 'refuse', with a /status notice. The install and update commands start no session and are never refused over a remote entry: they report the refusal in /status. An entry whose other fields fail validation runs no helper; from MDM or the managed settings file, any value but 'continue' on it then refuses to start Claude Code until the entry is fixed, unless a static settings payload (the entry's own, kept when it validates, the linux entry's for a wsl one, or the map's "default") serves in its place. From remote, a non-interactive session runs the helper off settings verified this session without the interactive approval, so 'refuse' there too means the helper ran and failed; a launch whose remote settings could not be verified this session (offline, fetch failed) starts without the helper regardless; and a failure first reached after the session has started (settings verified or approved mid-session, which on a machine that only ever runs non-interactively is every launch) ends a session no person watches (non-interactive, a background session no client is attached to, or a teammate session) as the refused start would have, and leaves a watched interactive one (a terminal, with or without remote control, or an attached background session) running under a /status notice with its next start refused. Background refresh failures always keep the last good output whatever this says
