# agent-skills

This is the agent-skills project — a collection of production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.

> **Scope:** This file configures agents working on the [`addyosmani/agent-skills`](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) repository itself, not other projects. Don't copy it into another project or a global agent configuration; the reusable assets are the skills in `skills/`.

## Project Structure

```
skills/       → Core skills (SKILL.md per directory)
agents/       → Reusable agent personas (code-reviewer, test-engineer, security-auditor, web-performance-auditor)
hooks/        → Session lifecycle hooks
.claude/commands/ → Slash commands (/spec, /plan, /build, /test, /review, /code-simplify, /ship; plus /webperf specialist audit)
references/   → Supplementary checklists (testing, performance, security, accessibility, observability)
evals/        → Skill eval cases + framework (see evals/README.md)
docs/         → Setup guides for different tools
```

## Skills by Phase

**Define:** interview-me, idea-refine, spec-driven-development
**Plan:** planning-and-task-breakdown
**Build:** incremental-implementation, test-driven-development, context-engineering, source-driven-development, doubt-driven-development, frontend-ui-engineering, api-and-interface-design
**Verify:** browser-testing-with-devtools, debugging-and-error-recovery
**Review:** code-review-and-quality, code-simplification, security-and-hardening, performance-optimization
**Ship:** git-workflow-and-versioning, ci-cd-and-automation, deprecation-and-migration, documentation-and-adrs, observability-and-instrumentation, shipping-and-launch

## Conventions

- Every skill lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Description starts with what the skill does (third person), followed by trigger conditions ("Use when...")
- Every skill has: Overview, When to Use, Process, Common Rationalizations, Red Flags, Verification
- Shared references are in the root `references/` directory; the emerging convention for self-contained, distributable skills keeps a skill's own references inside `skills/<name>/references/`
- Supporting files only created when content exceeds 100 lines
