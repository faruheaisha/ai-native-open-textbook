# Explain Concepts with LLMs

import \{ Tabs, Tab \} from 'nextra/components'
import \{Callout\} from 'nextra/components'

## Background
The following prompt tests an LLM's capabilities to explain or summarize concepts.

## Prompt
```markdown
Antibiotics are a type of medication used to treat bacterial infections. They work by either killing the bacteria or preventing them from reproducing, allowing the body’s immune system to fight off the infection. Antibiotics are usually taken orally in the form of pills, capsules, or liquid solutions, or sometimes administered intravenously. They are not effective against viral infections, and using them inappropriately can lead to antibiotic resistance.

Explain the above in one sentence:
```

## Code / API

  
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    client = OpenAI()

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        \{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Antibiotics are a type of medication used to treat bacterial infections.

    ],
    temperature=1,
    max_tokens=250,
    top_p=1,
    frequency_penalty=0,
    presence_penalty=0
    )
    ```

        ```python
        import fireworks.client
        fireworks.client.api_key = "&lt;FIREWORKS_API_KEY>"
        completion = fireworks.client.ChatCompletion.create(
