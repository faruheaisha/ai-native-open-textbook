# Setup TS Deep Modules

Make every package in this repo a **deep module**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. A package's public surface is its **entry points** (the files at the package root), and everything in its subfolders is hidden. This skill installs [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) and the rules that make the entry points the only way in, then proves the rules bite.

For the vocabulary (deep module, interface, seam, depth), call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" and use its language throughout.

## The shape this enforces

```
src/packages/
  <name>/
    index.ts        ← an entry point (public). Import this from outside.
    client.ts       ← another entry point. Packages may expose SEVERAL.
    lib/            ← implementation: hidden from outside, free to import each other.
    tests/          ← co-located tests + fixtures (a subfolder, so private).
```

The public surface is the package's **root files**, not one designated `index.ts`. By convention implementation lives in `lib/` and tests in `tests/`, giving every package the same two-folder shape. The rule itself is general, though: *anything* in *any* subfolder is private, so you never extend the config to add a folder.

Four rules, all `error`:

1. **Entry-point boundary**: code outside a package (app code or another package) may import only that package's entry points (its root files), never anything in its subfolders.
2. **Intra-package freedom**: a package's own files import each other freely.
3. **Tests through the entry points**: files under `<pkg>/tests/` may import any package's entry points and their own `tests/` fixtures, but never any package's subfolder internals (not even their own). Integration tests across packages are fine; deep imports are not.
4. **No cycles**: no dependency cycles.

**Entry points, not a barrel.** Because the public surface is *every* root file, a package can expose several small entry points (`index.ts`, `client.ts`, `server.ts`) instead of funnelling everything through one giant `index.ts`. Barrel files that re-export a whole subtree are discouraged; keep entry points small and hide implementation in subfolders.

Layering (which packages may depend on which) is a *different* concern and is left as a commented stub in the config for this repo to fill in.

## Steps

### 1. Detect the environment

- **Package manager**: `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `bun.lockb` → bun, else npm. Use it for every command below (`pnpm`/`yarn`/`npm run`/`bunx`).
- **Packages root**: if `src/` exists use `src/packages`, else `packages`. Confirm the choice with the user if the repo already has a different obvious convention.
- **Existing config**: check for a `.dependency-cruiser.*` file. If one exists, do **not** overwrite it: merge the four rules and the options in, and tell the user what you added.

**Done when:** package manager, packages root, and existing-config status are all known.

### 2. Install dependency-cruiser

Install `dependency-cruiser` as a devDependency with the detected package manager.

**Done when:** `dependency-cruiser` is in `devDependencies`.

### 3. Write the config

Copy [`dependency-cruiser.config.cjs`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/3cca18b368ae95cdbdebbff572ccafa662551015/skills/in-progress/setup-ts-deep-modules/dependency-cruiser.config.cjs) to the repo root as `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`. Set `PACKAGES_ROOT` to the root detected in step 1. The rules are path-depth based and extension-agnostic, so nothing else needs adapting.

**Done when:** `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` exists with the correct `PACKAGES_ROOT`, and the four forbidden rules are present.

### 4. Wire it into the checks
