## input_audio_buffer.append

Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio
buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. A "commit" will create a new
user message item in the conversation history from the buffer content and clear the buffer.
Input audio transcription (if enabled) will be generated when the buffer is committed.

If VAD is enabled the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide
when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer
manually. Input audio noise reduction operates on writes to the audio buffer.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum
of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the
VAD to be more responsive. Unlike most other client events, the server will
not send a confirmation response to this event.
