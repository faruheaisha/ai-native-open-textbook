# Update RBAC Group

**POST** `/v1/organizations/rbac_groups/\{group_id\}`

Update an RBAC Group's name. Groups provisioned by an identity provider (source type `"scim"`) cannot be modified via the API while an organization in the tenant uses SCIM provisioning.

The RBAC Groups API is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only.

## Path parameters

- `group_id: string`

  ID of the RBAC Group.

## Body parameters

- `name: optional string or null`

  Name of the RBAC Group. Not uniqueness-enforced.

  maxLength: 255, minLength: 1

## Returns

- `BetaRBACGroup object`

  - `type: "rbac_group"`

    Object type.

    For RBAC Groups, this is always `"rbac_group"`.

    default: rbac_group

  - `id: string`

    ID of the RBAC Group.

  - `created_at: string`

    RFC 3339 timestamp of when the RBAC Group was created.

    format: date-time

  - `name: string`

    Name of the RBAC Group. Not uniqueness-enforced.

  - `roles: array of string or null`

    RBAC Role IDs attached to this RBAC Group. Role attachment is managed in the admin settings and is read-only on this API. `null` means role data was temporarily unavailable — retry to distinguish from an empty list.

  - `source_type: "direct" or "scim"`

    How the RBAC Group was created: `"direct"` for groups created directly (for example, in the organization's admin settings), `"scim"` for groups provisioned by the identity provider.

    - `"direct"`

    - `"scim"`

  - `updated_at: string`

    RFC 3339 timestamp of when the RBAC Group was last updated.

    format: date-time

## Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/rbac_groups/$GROUP_ID \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
    -H 'anthropic-beta: ce-user-management-2026-07-13' \
    -H "X-Api-Key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
          "name": "Engineering"
        }'
```
