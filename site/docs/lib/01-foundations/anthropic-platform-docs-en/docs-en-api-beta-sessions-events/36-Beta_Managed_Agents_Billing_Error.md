### Beta Managed Agents Billing Error

- `BetaManagedAgentsBillingError object`

  The caller's organization or workspace cannot make model requests — out of credits or spend limit reached. Retrying with the same credentials will not succeed; the caller must resolve the billing state.

  - `type: "billing_error"`

  - `message: string`

    Human-readable error description.

  - `retry_status: BetaManagedAgentsRetryStatusRetrying or BetaManagedAgentsRetryStatusExhausted or BetaManagedAgentsRetryStatusTerminal`

    What the client should do next in response to this error.

    - `BetaManagedAgentsRetryStatusRetrying object`

      The server is retrying automatically. Client should wait; the same error type may fire again as retrying, then once as exhausted when the retry budget runs out.

      - `type: "retrying"`

    - `BetaManagedAgentsRetryStatusExhausted object`

      This turn is dead; queued inputs are flushed and the session returns to idle. Client may send a new prompt.

      - `type: "exhausted"`

    - `BetaManagedAgentsRetryStatusTerminal object`

      The session encountered a terminal error and will transition to `terminated` state.

      - `type: "terminal"`
