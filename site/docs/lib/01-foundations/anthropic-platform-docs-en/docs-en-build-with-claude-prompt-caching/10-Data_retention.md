## Data retention

Prompt caching (both automatic and explicit) is ZDR eligible. Anthropic does not store the raw text of your prompts or Claude's responses.

KV (key-value) cache representations and cryptographic hashes of cached content are held in memory only and are not stored at rest. Cached entries have a minimum lifetime of 5 minutes (standard) or 1 hour (extended), after which they are promptly, though not immediately, deleted. Cache entries are isolated between organizations and, on the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, and Microsoft Foundry, between workspaces within an organization.

For ZDR eligibility across all features, see [API and data retention](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).
