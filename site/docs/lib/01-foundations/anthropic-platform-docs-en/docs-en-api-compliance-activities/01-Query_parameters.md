### Query parameters

- `activity_types: optional array of "abuse_decision_received" or "account_deleted" or "admin_api_key_created" or 490 more`

  Filter activities by type. See the response `data` schema for the additional fields each type returns. Cannot be combined with `exclude_activity_types[]`.

  - `"abuse_decision_received"`

    An external anti-abuse service reported a consequential decision about a sign-in or sign-up attempt.

  - `"account_deleted"`

    User-initiated self-service account deletion.

  - `"admin_api_key_created"`

    An admin API key was created.

  - `"admin_api_key_deleted"`

    An admin API key was deleted.

  - `"admin_api_key_updated"`

    An admin API key was updated (renamed or activated/deactivated).

  - `"admin_connector_request_resolved"`

    Admin approved or dismissed pending member requests to enable an MCP connector.

  - `"admin_request_created"`

    Admin request created by an org member (seat upgrade, limit increase, join org, end-user invite).

  - `"admin_setup_checklist_step_delegated"`

    A step of the Claude Enterprise admin setup checklist was delegated to a teammate — an organization member, or an email address that has not joined the organization yet — replacing any earlier delegation of that step.

  - `"admin_setup_checklist_step_delegation_cancelled"`

    The delegation of a Claude Enterprise admin setup checklist step was cancelled.

  - `"age_verified"`

    User age was verified.

  - `"anonymous_mobile_login_attempted"`

    Anonymous mobile login was attempted.

  - `"api_key_created"`

    Activity logged when a new API key is created.

    Audit log export was initiated.

  - `"billing_emails_updated"`

    The organization's billing email recipients were updated.

  - `"ccr_agent_created"`

    A Claude Code agent was created.

  - `"ccr_agent_deleted"`

    A Claude Code agent was deleted.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_credential_created"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy credential was created. Credentials hold the secrets the agent proxy injects into requests Claude Code sessions send to approved external services; each credential belongs to an agent proxy profile. Audit events carry only credential names and settings, never the secret material itself.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_credential_deleted"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy credential was deleted. Its secret material was removed and can no longer be sent to any host.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_credential_rotated"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy credential's secret material was replaced. The replacement keeps the same name, profile, and allowed hosts under a new credential identifier, and everything that referenced the old credential now uses the replacement.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_credential_updated"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy credential's settings were updated. Only the display name and the allowed host patterns can be updated; the secret material can only be replaced through a rotation.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_network_events_listed"`

    A Claude Code network activity export was accessed for the given hour.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_profile_bound"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy profile was bound to a scope, applying its policy to Claude Code sessions in that scope.

    A Claude Code agent proxy profile was created. Agent proxy profiles are named, reusable bundles of access policy that administrators bind to parts of the organization.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_profile_deleted"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy profile was deleted, removing its policy from everything it was bound to.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_profile_unbound"`

    A Claude Code agent proxy profile's configuration was updated.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_provisioning_credential_rejected"`

    An organization owner rejected a credential that a teammate submitted via an agent proxy provisioning link: the credential and its disabled rule were deleted and the link was revoked. The actor is the owner; the submitter is recorded for attribution.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_provisioning_link_enabled"`

    An organization owner enabled a credential that a teammate submitted via an agent proxy provisioning link: the disabled rule created at submission was switched to enforce, so the credential now takes traffic. The actor is the owner; the submitter is the actor on the prior ccr_agent_proxy_provisioning_link_submitted event.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_provisioning_link_generated"`

    An organization owner generated a one-time agent proxy credential provisioning link so a teammate can submit a credential into the target agent proxy profile without holding the owner role.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_provisioning_link_revoked"`

    An organization owner revoked an unfilled agent proxy provisioning link.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_provisioning_link_submitted"`

    A teammate submitted a credential via an agent proxy provisioning link. The credential and a disabled rule are created; the credential takes traffic only after an organization owner enables the submitted credential. This event records the link-mediated lifecycle; the credential itself additionally emits ccr_agent_proxy_credential_created.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_rule_created"`

    An agent proxy rule was created. A rule decides what happens to a session's outbound requests that match it.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_rule_deleted"`

    An agent proxy rule was deleted.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_rule_updated"`

    An agent proxy rule was updated. An update replaces everything the rule matches and does, so the host name patterns here are the rule's complete set after the update.

  - `"ccr_agent_slack_access_scope_created"`

    A Claude Code agent was granted access to read or write in an additional Slack channel beyond the one it is assigned to.

    A Claude Code agent's configuration was updated. Also emitted with updated_fields ["is_virtual"] alone when an auto-provisioned agent is promoted to a configured one, whether by an update request targeting it or by binding an agent proxy profile to it.

  - `"ccr_role_channel_assignment_deleted"`

    CcrRoleChannelAssignmentDeleted is emitted when an org owner/admin removes an RBAC role's channel assignment row (the role reverts to granting zero channels).

    An attempt to access an artifact failed.

  - `"claude_artifact_commented"`

    An agent proxy rule was created. A rule decides what happens to a session's outbound requests that match it.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_rule_deleted"`

    An agent proxy rule was deleted.

  - `"ccr_agent_proxy_rule_updated"`

- `limit: optional number`

  Maximum results (default: 100, max: 5000)

  default: 100, maximum: 5000, minimum: 1

- `order: optional "asc" or "desc"`

  Sort direction by `created_at`. `desc` (default) returns newest-first; `asc` returns oldest-first for incremental sync. Activities become queryable after a short asynchronous ingestion delay. When using `asc` with `after_id` for incremental sync, late-arriving rows with timestamps behind the cursor will be skipped; consumers that need at-least-once delivery should periodically re-poll an overlap window via `created_at.gte` and deduplicate by `id`. `after_id` and `before_id` are relative to this order.

  default: desc

  - `"asc"`

  - `"desc"`

- `organization_ids: optional array of string`

  Filter activities by organization IDs (accepts `org_...` or organization UUID). Enumerate IDs via `GET /v1/compliance/organizations`.

- `user_ids: optional array of string`

  Alias for `actor_ids[]`, for consistency with other compliance routes. If both are provided, the lists are merged.
