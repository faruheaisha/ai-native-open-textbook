### Beta Managed Agents Session Usage

- `BetaManagedAgentsSessionUsage object`

  Cumulative token usage for a session across all turns.

  - `active_seconds: optional number`

    Cumulative time in seconds during which the session had at least one thread in running status. Overlapping activity from concurrent threads is counted once, unlike `stats.active_seconds`, which sums each thread's own active time. This is the duration the session's runtime cost is priced on.

    format: double

  - `cache_creation: optional BetaManagedAgentsCacheCreationUsage`

    Prompt-cache creation token usage broken down by cache lifetime.

    - `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: optional number`

      Tokens used to create 1-hour ephemeral cache entries.

      format: int32

    - `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens: optional number`

      Tokens used to create 5-minute ephemeral cache entries.

      format: int32

  - `cache_read_input_tokens: optional number`

    Total tokens read from prompt cache.

    format: int32

  - `input_tokens: optional number`

    Total input tokens consumed across all turns.

    format: int32

  - `list_cost: optional BetaMonetaryAmount or null`

    A monetary amount in a specific currency.

    - `amount: string`

      Amount in minor units of the currency, as an integer decimal string with no leading zeros: "2500" is $25.00 and "50" is fifty cents. A string rather than a number so no float rounding is ever applied.

    - `currency: BetaCurrency`

      Uppercase ISO-4217 currency code. `USD` is the only currency currently supported; the accepted set is closed and grows only when a new currency is priced.

  - `output_tokens: optional number`

    Total output tokens generated across all turns.

    format: int32

  - `server_tool_use: optional BetaManagedAgentsServerToolUsage or null`

    Cumulative count of server-executed tool invocations, broken down by tool.

    - `web_fetch_requests: optional number`

      Number of server-executed web fetch requests.

      format: int32

    - `web_search_requests: optional number`

      Number of server-executed web search requests.

      format: int32
