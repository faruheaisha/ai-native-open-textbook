### Beta Managed Agents Budget Limit

- `BetaManagedAgentsBudgetLimit object`

  A hard spend ceiling. The session stops issuing new model requests once the tracked list cost reaches `max_list_cost`.

  - `type: "limit"`

  - `max_list_cost: BetaMonetaryAmount`

    A monetary amount in a specific currency.

    - `amount: string`

      Amount in minor units of the currency, as an integer decimal string with no leading zeros: "2500" is $25.00 and "50" is fifty cents. A string rather than a number so no float rounding is ever applied.

    - `currency: BetaCurrency`

      Uppercase ISO-4217 currency code. `USD` is the only currency currently supported; the accepted set is closed and grows only when a new currency is priced.
