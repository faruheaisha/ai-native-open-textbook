## Capability-specific tips

### Improved vision capabilities

Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.6 have improved vision capabilities compared to previous Claude models. They perform better on image processing and data extraction tasks, particularly when there are multiple images present in context. These improvements carry over to computer use, where the models can more reliably interpret screenshots and UI elements. You can also use these models to analyze videos by breaking them up into frames.

One technique that has proven effective to further boost performance is to give Claude a crop tool or [agent skill](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). Testing has shown consistent uplift on image evaluations when Claude is able to "zoom" in on relevant regions of an image. Anthropic has created a [recipe for the crop tool](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/multimodal-crop-tool).

### Frontend design

Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.6 build complex, real-world web applications with strong frontend design. However, without guidance, models can default to generic patterns that create what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. To create distinctive, creative frontends that surprise and delight:

  For a detailed guide on improving frontend design, see the blog post on [improving frontend design through skills](https://www.claude.com/blog/improving-frontend-design-through-skills).

For frontend design work outside the API, [Claude Design](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/14604416-get-started-with-claude-design) provides a canvas and design tools where Claude generates and iterates on designs interactively.

Here's a system prompt snippet you can use to encourage better frontend design:

```text Sample prompt for frontend aesthetics wrap
<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this
creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive
frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic
fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the
frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.
Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw
from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only
solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact
moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer
CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall
aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the
context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You
still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across
generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
