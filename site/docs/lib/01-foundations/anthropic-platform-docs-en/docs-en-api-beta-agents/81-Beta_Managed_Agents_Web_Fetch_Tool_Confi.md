### Beta Managed Agents Web Fetch Tool Config Params

- `BetaManagedAgentsWebFetchToolConfigParams object`

  Configuration override for the web_fetch tool.

  - `type: optional "web_fetch"`

  - `name: "web_fetch"`

    Must be "web_fetch".

  - `allowed_domains: optional array of string`

    Only fetch URLs whose host is one of these domains or a subdomain of one. Each entry is a plain hostname like "docs.example.com" (no scheme, port, or path). At most 64 entries; an empty list is rejected (omit the field instead). Cannot be combined with blocked_domains.

  - `blocked_domains: optional array of string`

    Never fetch URLs whose host is one of these domains or a subdomain of one. Each entry is a plain hostname like "ads.example.com" (no scheme, port, or path). At most 64 entries; an empty list is rejected (omit the field instead). Cannot be combined with allowed_domains.

  - `enabled: optional boolean or null`

    Whether this tool is enabled and available to Claude. Overrides the default_config setting.

  - `max_content_tokens: optional number or null`

    Maximum number of tokens of fetched text content to include in context per call. Does not apply to binary content such as PDFs.

    format: int32

  - `permission_policy: optional BetaManagedAgentsAlwaysAllowPolicy or BetaManagedAgentsAlwaysAskPolicy or BetaManagedAgentsAutoPolicy or null`

    Permission policy for tool execution.

    - `BetaManagedAgentsAlwaysAllowPolicy object`

      Tool calls are automatically approved without user confirmation.

      - `type: "always_allow"`

    - `BetaManagedAgentsAlwaysAskPolicy object`

      Tool calls require user confirmation before execution.

      - `type: "always_ask"`

    - `BetaManagedAgentsAutoPolicy object`

      The server decides each tool call individually: it judges, from the tool, its input, and the session content so far, whether the call is safe to execute or high-risk, and evaluates it to allow when judged safe and to deny when judged high-risk. A call the server cannot reach a judgement on evaluates to ask.

      - `type: "auto"`
