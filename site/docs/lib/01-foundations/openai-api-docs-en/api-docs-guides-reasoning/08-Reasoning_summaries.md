## Reasoning summaries

While we don't expose the raw reasoning tokens emitted by the model, you can view a summary of the model's reasoning using the `summary` parameter. See our [model documentation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models) to check which reasoning models support summaries.

Different models support different reasoning summary settings. For example, our computer use model supports the `concise` summarizer, while o4-mini supports `detailed`. To access the most detailed summarizer available for a model, set the value of this parameter to `auto`. `auto` will be equivalent to `detailed` for most reasoning models today, but there may be more granular settings in the future.

Reasoning summary output is part of the `summary` array in the `reasoning` [output item](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses#responses/object-output). This output will not be included unless you explicitly opt in to including reasoning summaries.

The example below shows how to make an API request that includes a reasoning summary.

Include a reasoning summary with the API response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-6-astra",
  input: "What is the capital of France?",
  reasoning: {
    effort: "low",
    summary: "auto",
  },
});

console.log(response.output);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-6-astra",
    input="What is the capital of France?",
    reasoning={"effort": "low", "summary": "auto"},
)

print(response.output)
```

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/openai/openai-go/v3"
	"github.com/openai/openai-go/v3/responses"
)

func main() {
	client := openai.NewClient()

	response, err := client.Responses.New(context.Background(), responses.ResponseNewParams{
		Model: "gpt-6-astra",
		Input: responses.ResponseNewParamsInputUnion{
			OfString: openai.String("What is the capital of France?"),
		},
		Reasoning: responses.ReasoningParam{
			Effort:  responses.ReasoningEffortLow,
			Summary: responses.ReasoningSummaryAuto,
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(response.Output)
}
```

```java
import com.openai.client.OpenAIClient;
import com.openai.client.okhttp.OpenAIOkHttpClient;
import com.openai.models.Reasoning;
import com.openai.models.ReasoningEffort;
import com.openai.models.responses.ResponseCreateParams;

ResponseCreateParams params =
    ResponseCreateParams.builder()
        .model("gpt-6-astra")
        .input("What is the capital of France?")
        .reasoning(
            Reasoning.builder()
                .effort(ReasoningEffort.LOW)
                .summary(Reasoning.Summary.AUTO)
                .build())
        .build();

client.responses().create(params).output().stream()
    .flatMap(item -> item.reasoning().stream())
    .flatMap(reasoning -> reasoning.summary().stream())
    .forEach(summary -> System.out.println(summary.text()));
```

```csharp
using OpenAI.Responses;
#pragma warning disable OPENAI001

string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY")!;
ResponsesClient client = new(key);

CreateResponseOptions options = new()
{
    Model = "gpt-6-astra",
    ReasoningOptions = new ResponseReasoningOptions
    {
        ReasoningEffortLevel = ResponseReasoningEffortLevel.Low,
        ReasoningSummaryVerbosity = ResponseReasoningSummaryVerbosity.Auto,
    },
};
options.InputItems.Add(ResponseItem.CreateUserMessageItem("What is the capital of France?"));

ResponseResult response = await client.CreateResponseAsync(options);
foreach (ReasoningResponseItem reasoning in response.OutputItems.OfType<ReasoningResponseItem>())
{
    Console.WriteLine(reasoning.GetSummaryText());
}
Console.WriteLine(response.GetOutputText());
```

```ruby
require "openai"

client = OpenAI::Client.new

response = client.responses.create(
  model: "gpt-6-astra",
  input: "What is the capital of France?",
  reasoning: {effort: :low, summary: :auto}
)

puts(response.output)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-6-astra",
    "input": "What is the capital of France?",
    "reasoning": {
        "effort": "low",
        "summary": "auto"
    }
  }'
```

This API request will return an output array with both an assistant message and a summary of the model's reasoning in generating that response.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "rs_6876cf02e0bc8192b74af0fb64b715ff06fa2fcced15a5ac",
    "type": "reasoning",
    "summary": [
      {
        "type": "summary_text",
        "text": "**Answering a simple question**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a straightforward question: the capital of France is Paris. It\u2019s a well-known fact, and I want to keep it brief and to the point. Paris is known for its history, art, and culture, so it might be nice to add just a hint of that charm. But mostly, I\u2019ll aim to focus on delivering a clear and direct answer, ensuring the user gets what they\u2019re looking for without any extra fluff."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "msg_6876cf054f58819284ecc1058131305506fa2fcced15a5ac",
    "type": "message",
    "status": "completed",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "output_text",
        "annotations": [],
        "logprobs": [],
        "text": "The capital of France is Paris."
      }
    ],
    "role": "assistant"
  }
]
```

Before using summarizers with our latest reasoning models, you may need to
  complete [organization
  verification](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification)
  to ensure safe deployment. Get started with verification on the [platform
  settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general).
