## Conversation Flow

This section covers how to structure the dialogue into clear, goal-driven phases so the model knows exactly what to do at each step. It defines the purpose of each phase, the instructions for moving through it, and the concrete “exit criteria” for transitioning to the next. This prevents the model from stalling, skipping steps, or jumping ahead, and ensures the conversation stays organized from greeting to resolution.

As well, by organizing your prompt into various conversation states, it becomes easier to identify error modes and iterate more effectively.

- **When to use**: If conversations feel disorganized, stall before reaching the goal, or the model struggles to effectively complete the objective.
- **What it does**: Breaks the interaction into phases with clear goals, instructions and exit criteria.
- **How to adapt**: Rename phases to match your workflow; modify instructions for each phase to follow your intended behavior; keep “Exit when” concrete and minimal.

#### Example

```
# Conversation Flow
## 1) Greeting
Goal: Set tone and invite the reason for calling.
How to respond:
- Identify as NorthLoop Internet Support.
- Keep the opener brief and invite the caller’s goal.
- Confirm that customer is a Northloop customer
Exit to Discovery: Caller states they are a Northloop customer and mentions an initial goal or symptom.

## 2) Discover
Goal: Classify the issue and capture minimal details.
How to respond:
- Determine billing vs connectivity with one targeted question.
- For connectivity: collect the service address.
- For billing/account: collect email or phone used on the account.
Exit when: Intent and address (for connectivity) or email/phone (for billing) are known.

## 3) Verify
Goal: Confirm identity and retrieve the account.
How to respond:
- Once you have email or phone, call lookup_account(email_or_phone).
- If lookup fails, try the alternate identifier once; otherwise proceed with general guidance or offer escalation if account actions are required.
Exit when: Account ID is returned.

## 4) Diagnose
Goal: Decide outage vs local issue.
How to respond:
- For connectivity, call check_outage(address).
- If outage=true, skip local steps; move to Resolve with outage context.
- If outage=false, guide a short reboot/cabling check; confirm each step’s result before continuing.
Exit when: Root cause known.

## 5) Resolve
Goal: Apply fix, credit, or appointment.
How to respond:
- If confirmed outage > 240 minutes in the last 7 days, call refund_credit(account_id, 60).
- If outage=false and issue persists after basic checks, offer “10am–12pm ET” or “2pm–4pm ET” and call schedule_technician(account_id, chosen window).
- If the local fix worked, state the result and next steps briefly.
Exit when: A fix/credit/appointment has been applied and acknowledged by the caller.

## 6) Confirm/Close
Goal: Confirm outcome and end cleanly.
How to respond:
- Restate the result and any next step (e.g., stabilization window or tech ETA).
- Invite final questions; close politely if none.
Exit when: Caller declines more help.
```

### Sample Phrases

Sample phrases act as “anchor examples” for the model. They show the style, brevity, and tone you want it to follow, without locking it into one rigid response.

- **When to use**: Responses lack your brand style or are not consistent.
- **What it does**: Provides sample phrases the model can vary to stay natural and brief.
- **How to adapt**: Swap examples for brand-fit; keep the “do not always use” warning.

#### Example

```
# Sample Phrases
- Below are sample examples that you should use for inspiration. DO NOT ALWAYS USE THESE EXAMPLES, VARY YOUR RESPONSES.

Acknowledgements: “On it.” “One moment.” “Good question.”
Clarifiers: “Do you want A or B?” “What’s the deadline?”
Bridges: “Here’s the quick plan.” “Let’s keep it simple.”
Empathy (brief): “That’s frustrating—let’s fix it.”
Closers: “Anything else before we wrap?” “Happy to help next time.”
```

_Note: If your voice system ends up consistently only repeating the sample phrases, leading to a more robotic voice experience, try adding the Variety constraint. We’ve seen this fix the issue._

### Conversation flow + Sample Phrases

It is a useful pattern to add sample phrases in the different conversation flow states to teach the model what a good response looks like:

#### Example

```
# Conversation Flow
## 1) Greeting
Goal: Set tone and invite the reason for calling.
How to respond:
- Identify as NorthLoop Internet Support.
- Keep the opener brief and invite the caller’s goal.
Sample phrases (do not always repeat the same phrases, vary your responses):
- “Thanks for calling NorthLoop Internet—how can I help today?”
- “You’ve reached NorthLoop Support. What’s going on with your service?”
- “Hi there—tell me what you’d like help with.”
Exit when: Caller states an initial goal or symptom.

## 2) Discover
Goal: Classify the issue and capture minimal details.
How to respond:
- Determine billing vs connectivity with one targeted question.
- For connectivity: collect the service address.
- For billing/account: collect email or phone used on the account.
Sample phrases (do not always repeat the same phrases, vary your responses):
- “Is this about your bill or your internet speed?”
- “What address are you using for the connection?”
- “What’s the email or phone number on the account?”
Exit when: Intent and address (for connectivity) or email/phone (for billing) are known.

## 3) Verify
Goal: Confirm identity and retrieve the account.
How to respond:
- Once you have email or phone, call lookup_account(email_or_phone).
- If lookup fails, try the alternate identifier once; otherwise proceed with general guidance or offer escalation if account actions are required.
Sample phrases:
- “Thanks—looking up your account now.”
- “If that doesn’t pull up, what’s the other contact—email or phone?”
- “Found your account. I’ll take care of this.”
Exit when: Account ID is returned.

## 4) Diagnose
Goal: Decide outage vs local issue.
How to respond:
- For connectivity, call check_outage(address).
- If outage=true, skip local steps; move to Resolve with outage context.
- If outage=false, guide a short reboot/cabling check; confirm each step’s result before continuing.
Sample phrases (do not always repeat the same phrases, vary your responses):
- “I’m running a quick outage check for your area.”
- “No outage reported—let’s try a fast modem reboot.”
- “Please confirm the modem lights: is the internet light solid or blinking?”
Exit when: Root cause known.

## 5) Resolve
Goal: Apply fix, credit, or appointment.
How to respond:
- If confirmed outage > 240 minutes in the last 7 days, call refund_credit(account_id, 60).
- If outage=false and issue persists after basic checks, offer “10am–12pm ET” or “2pm–4pm ET” and call schedule_technician(account_id, chosen window).
- If the local fix worked, state the result and next steps briefly.
Sample phrases (do not always repeat the same phrases, vary your responses):
- “There’s been an extended outage—adding a 60-minute bill credit now.”
- “No outage—let’s book a technician. I can do 10am–12pm ET or 2pm–4pm ET.”
- “Credit applied—you’ll see it on your next bill.”
Exit when: A fix/credit/appointment has been applied and acknowledged by the caller.

## 6) Confirm/Close
Goal: Confirm outcome and end cleanly.
How to respond:
- Restate the result and any next step (e.g., stabilization window or tech ETA).
- Invite final questions; close politely if none.
Sample phrases (do not always repeat the same phrases, vary your responses):
- “We’re all set: [credit applied / appointment booked / service restored].”
- “You should see stable speeds within a few minutes.”
- “Your technician window is 10am–12pm ET.”
Exit when: Caller declines more help.

```

### Advanced Conversation Flow

As use cases grow more complex, you’ll need a structure that scales while keeping the model effective. The key is balancing maintainability with simplicity: too many rigid states can overload the model, hurting performance and making conversations feel robotic.

A better approach is to design flows that reduce the model’s perceived complexity. By handling state in a structured but flexible way, you make it easier for the model to stay focused and responsive, which improves user experience.

Two common patterns for managing complex scenarios are:

1. Conversation Flow as State Machine
2. Dynamic Conversation Flow via session.updates

#### Conversation Flow as State Machine

Define your conversation as a JSON structure that encodes both states and transitions. This makes it easy to reason about coverage, identify edge cases, and track changes over time. Since it’s stored as code, you can version, diff, and extend it as your flow evolves. A state machine also gives you fine-grained control over exactly how and when the conversation moves from one state to another.

#### Example

```json
# Conversation States
[
  {
    "id": "1_greeting",
    "description": "Begin each conversation with a warm, friendly greeting, identifying the service and offering help.",
    "instructions": [
        "Use the company name 'Snowy Peak Boards' and provide a warm welcome.",
        "Let them know upfront that for any account-specific assistance, you’ll need some verification details."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Hello, this is Snowy Peak Boards. Thanks for reaching out! How can I help you today?"
    ],
    "transitions": [{
      "next_step": "2_get_first_name",
      "condition": "Once greeting is complete."
    }, {
      "next_step": "3_get_and_verify_phone",
      "condition": "If the user provides their first name."
    }]
  },
  {
    "id": "2_get_first_name",
    "description": "Ask for the user’s name (first name only).",
    "instructions": [
      "Politely ask, 'Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?'",
      "Do NOT verify or spell back the name; just accept it."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?"
    ],
    "transitions": [{
      "next_step": "3_get_and_verify_phone",
      "condition": "Once name is obtained, OR name is already provided."
    }]
  },
  {
    "id": "3_get_and_verify_phone",
    "description": "Request phone number and verify by repeating it back.",
    "instructions": [
      "Politely request the user’s phone number.",
      "Once provided, confirm it by repeating each digit and ask if it’s correct.",
      "If the user corrects you, confirm AGAIN to make sure you understand.",
    ],
    "examples": [
      "I'll need some more information to access your account if that's okay. May I have your phone number, please?",
      "You said 0-2-1-5-5-5-1-2-3-4, correct?",
      "You said 4-5-6-7-8-9-0-1-2-3, correct?"
    ],
    "transitions": [{
      "next_step": "4_authentication_DOB",
      "condition": "Once phone number is confirmed"
    }]
  },
...
```

#### Dynamic Conversation Flow

In this pattern, the conversation adapts in real time by updating the system prompt and tool list based on the current state. Instead of exposing the model to all possible rules and tools at once, you only provide what’s relevant to the active phase of the conversation.

When the end conditions for a state are met, you use session.update to transition, replacing the prompt and tools with those needed for the next phase.

This approach reduces the model’s cognitive load, making it easier for it to handle complex tasks without being distracted by unnecessary context.

#### Example

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Literal

State = Literal["verify", "resolve"]

# Allowed transitions
TRANSITIONS: Dict[State, List[State]] = {
    "verify": ["resolve"],
    "resolve": [],  # terminal
}

def build_state_change_tool(current: State) -> dict:
    allowed = TRANSITIONS[current]
    readable = ", ".join(allowed) if allowed else "no further states (terminal)"
    return {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "set_conversation_state",
        "description": (
            f"Switch the conversation phase. Current: '{current}'. "
            f"You may switch only to: {readable}. "
            "Call this AFTER exit criteria are satisfied."
        ),
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"next_state": {"type": "string", "enum": allowed}},
            "required": ["next_state"],
        },
    }

# Minimal business tools per state
TOOLS_BY_STATE: Dict[State, List[dict]] = {
    "verify": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "lookup_account",
            "description": "Fetch account by email or phone.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {"email_or_phone": {"type": "string"}},
                "required": ["email_or_phone"],
            },
        }
    ],
    "resolve": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "schedule_technician",
            "description": "Book a technician visit.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "account_id": {"type": "string"},
                    "window": {"type": "string", "enum": ["10-12 ET", "14-16 ET"]},
                },
                "required": ["account_id", "window"],
            },
        }
    ],
}

        "- Ask for the email or phone on the account.\n"
        "- Read back digits one-by-one (e.g., '4-1-5… Is that correct?').\n"
        "Exit when: Account ID is returned.\n"

        "- Book the chosen window.\n"
        "Exit when: Appointment is confirmed.\n"
        "When exit is satisfied: end the call politely."
