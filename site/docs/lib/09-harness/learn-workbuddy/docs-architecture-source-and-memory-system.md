# Source And Memory System

This document explains the memory architecture used by the tutorial. It is a
clean-room architecture note, not a package analysis report. It avoids private
file names, local paths, raw logs, bundle excerpts, exact implementation
constants, and product-specific internals.

## Core Idea

Desktop agent memory is not one file. It is a set of stores with different
owners, lifetimes, trust levels, and prompt budgets.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  User["User input"]
  Prompt["Prompt assembly"]
  Workspace["Workspace memory"]
  UserMem["User memory"]
  Recall["Remote/profile recall"]
  Transcript["JSONL transcript"]
  Swap["Tool-result artifacts"]
  Compact["Context compaction"]
  Model["Model request"]
  Tools["Tool loop"]
  Store["Durable storage"]

  User --> Prompt
  Workspace --> Prompt
  UserMem --> Prompt
  Recall --> Prompt
  Transcript --> Compact --> Prompt
  Swap --> Prompt
  Prompt --> Model --> Tools
  Tools --> Transcript
  Tools --> Swap
  Workspace --> Store
  UserMem --> Store
  Transcript --> Store
  Swap --> Store
```

The model context window is RAM. Transcripts, artifacts, SQLite records, and
memory files are disk. The harness decides what gets loaded into RAM each turn.

## Five Memory Layers

| Layer | Owner | What It Stores | Tutorial Chapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Workspace memory | Current project | Decisions, project facts, recent work notes. | `s10_workspace_memory` |
| User memory | User profile | Cross-project preferences and stable constraints. | `s11_user_memory` |
| Remote/profile recall | Provider or service abstraction | Long-horizon recall and profile snippets. | `s12_cloud_memory` |
| Transcript | Session runtime | Append-only event stream for replay and evidence. | `s09_jsonl_transcript` |
| Tool-result artifacts | Storage layer | Full outputs that are too large for the prompt. | `s13_output_externalization` |

## Why Separate Them

Each layer answers a different question:

- Workspace memory: "What did we decide in this repo?"
- User memory: "How does this person like work to be done?"
- Remote/profile recall: "What long-horizon context might matter now?"
- Transcript: "What actually happened in this session?"
- Tool-result artifacts: "Where is the full output if the prompt only has a pointer?"

Collapsing these into one memory blob makes privacy, cost, and relevance worse.

## Prompt Assembly

Prompt assembly should be explicit and budgeted:

```text
PromptContext
  system identity
  task instructions
  selected workspace memory
  selected user memory
  selected recall snippets
  active tool schemas
  recent transcript summary
  artifact pointers
```

Good harnesses do not inject every possible memory. They select, summarize, and
defer. That is why this repository teaches memory together with deferred tools,
output externalization, and compaction.

## Selection Over Stuffing

A practical memory selector can start simple:

```python
def select_memories(query, manifest):
    scored = []
    for item in manifest:
        score = keyword_overlap(query, item.title + " " + item.summary)
        if score:
            scored.append((score, item))
    return [item for _, item in sorted(scored, reverse=True)[:5]]
```

The important teaching point is the manifest boundary:

```text
available memory manifest -> selector -> selected memory IDs -> prompt blocks
```

The model or selector should choose from a manifest; it should not receive every
private memory by default.

## Transcript Versus Memory

A transcript is evidence. Memory is curation.

| Store | Write Pattern | Read Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Transcript | Append every event. | Replay or summarize. |
| Memory | Append or update selected facts. | Inject only if relevant. |
| Artifact | Write full output once. | Load by pointer when needed. |

This distinction prevents a common bug: treating old chat logs as if they were
reliable long-term memory. A good harness summarizes and validates before
promoting session history into memory.

## Compaction

Compaction is not deletion. It is a controlled representation change:

```text
long transcript span -> compact summary item -> keep artifact pointers
```

The summary should preserve:

- user goal
- decisions made
- files or artifacts touched
- unresolved questions
- tool outputs that were externalized

The full transcript can remain on disk; the prompt gets a shorter working set.

## How The Tutorial Implements This

- `mini_workbuddy.storage` writes sessions, transcripts, memory files, and
  externalized tool results.
- `s09_jsonl_transcript` teaches append-only replay.
- `s10_workspace_memory` teaches project-scoped facts.
- `s11_user_memory` teaches cross-project preferences and dedupe.
- `s12_cloud_memory` teaches remote/profile recall as an abstraction.
- `s13_output_externalization` teaches swap-file style tool output.
- `s14_context_compact` teaches summary-based pressure relief.
- `s15_prompt_assembly` teaches budgeted prompt composition.

The production lesson is transferable even though the implementation is small:
keep memory layered, keep prompt assembly explicit, and never let raw history
or large tool output flood the context window.
