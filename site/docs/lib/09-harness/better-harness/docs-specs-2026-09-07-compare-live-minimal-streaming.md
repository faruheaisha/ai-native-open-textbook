# Minimal Compare lanes with revealed streaming and diagnosable ACP failures

## Traceability

- Spec ID: compare-live-minimal-streaming
- Status: Implemented

## Intent

Compare's live Agent surface answers one question: what do these two Agents do
with this prompt. Today four stacked bands sit above the lanes before any
comparison exists, the lanes render raw event bursts instead of the revealed
stream the Debugger already uses, and a failed ACP handshake reports
`Incoming transport closed` without the Agent's own reason.

Reduce the surface to a composer plus two lanes, reveal assistant text at the
established cadence, and carry the ACP Agent's retained stderr into the
handshake failure so the reader can act on it.

## Acceptance Scenarios

- AC-1: The live Compare surface renders exactly two docked regions: one
  composer band and the lane pair. The duplicated page title, the eyebrow, the
  restated prompt line, and the four-row metric table are gone; the Studio shell
  and sidebar remain the only place the area is named.
- AC-2: The prompt box and both Agent selects keep their accessible names
  (`What should both Agents do?`, `Left Agent`, `Right Agent`) without rendering
  a visible label above each control.
- AC-3: The shared-working-tree caveat survives as one sentence inside the
  composer, and the no-Agent boundary still renders as an alert when the host has
  no available ACP Agent.
- AC-4: Each lane header carries the Agent label, its run status, and its own
  tool-call, message, and warning counts, so removing the metric table loses no
  fact. Warning counts appear only when a lane has warnings.
- AC-5: Assistant text in a lane is revealed through the shared
  `useStreamingText` hook at the 16ms/200ms cadence, with a caret while the
  message is open, so a bursty Agent reads as streaming rather than as a block.
  `RunView` and Compare use one implementation, not two.
- AC-6: A lane whose event list is already scrolled to the bottom follows new
  events; a lane the reader scrolled up is left where it was.
- AC-7: When the Rust ACP host cannot complete `initialize`, the reported error
  includes the Agent's bounded stderr tail, so a misconfigured Agent names its own
  cause instead of only `Incoming transport closed`. This matches what the Node
  `AcpSdkExecutor` already does with the same stream; the tail decorates the
  error the caller receives and never becomes a retained protocol frame.
- AC-8: Focused tests cover the streaming hook module boundary, the reduced
  Compare DOM at wide, compact, and narrow widths with no horizontal overflow and
  no console or page errors, and the host reporting an Agent's stderr from a
  failed `connection.open`.

## Non-goals

- Streaming Agent thought/reasoning chunks. The neutral `HarnessRunEvent` set has
  no thought type, and adding one changes both executors, the Rust adapter, and
  every consumer. Out of scope here.
- Changing the SSE transport, the run request contract, or the ACP wire contract.
- Changing which Agents the catalog offers, or how a lane is launched.
- Fixing any individual Agent's local configuration.

## Plan and Tasks

1. Extract `useSmoothStreamingText` from `RunView.tsx` into
   `src/app/run/use-streaming-text.ts` as `useStreamingText`, and import it in
   both `RunView` and `CompareLiveView`.
2. Rewrite `CompareLiveView` as composer plus lanes: drop the header band, the
   winner/prompt restatement, and the metric table; move per-lane counts into the
   lane header; keep accessible names on the controls.
3. Reduce `.live-compare-*` styles to the two remaining regions and delete the
   metric-grid rules, including their compact/narrow overrides.
4. Prune the retired `compare.live` i18n keys and add the lane-count and
   control-name keys in both locales.
5. Retain a bounded stderr tail per ACP connection in the Rust host's existing
   debug tap and append it to `connection.open` failures.
6. Update the live-compare browser test to the reduced DOM, add a host test for a
   stderr-bearing handshake failure, and re-verify Studio at three widths.

## Test and Review Evidence

- AC-1/AC-2/AC-3/AC-4/AC-6: `packages/harness-studio/test/browser/acp-debugger.spec.mjs`
  live-compare test, updated for the reduced DOM and per-lane counts.
- AC-5: `packages/harness-studio/test/streaming-text.test.ts` keeps covering the
  reveal function; the hook module is imported by both surfaces so a divergence
  fails typecheck rather than passing silently.
- AC-7: `packages/better-harness-desktop/rust/acp-host/tests/stdio_host.rs`
  opens a connection to a command that prints to stderr and exits, and asserts
  the reported error carries that text.
- AC-8: package typechecks and test suites for `@qoder-ai/harness-studio`,
  `cargo test` for the host, and Playwright screenshots at 1440x900, 1024x768, and
  390x844.
- Risk: removing the metric table could hide a fact. Mitigated by moving every
  metric it showed into the lane header, where it sits next to the evidence it
  describes.
- Risk: stderr can carry secrets. Bounded to the last 40 lines / 4 KiB and kept
  on the failure path only, matching the boundary the Node executor already set
  for the same stream. Frame redaction does not apply: stderr is freeform text
  with no keys to match, so widening it into retained evidence is out of scope.

### Implemented evidence

- Measured first: the transport was already incremental. `qodercli --acp` emits
  one `agent_message_chunk` per token, and the Studio SSE endpoint forwards each
  as its own `text-delta`. Compare rendered `item.text` directly, so the Agent's
  ~100ms write coalescing landed as three or four visible jumps. The Debugger did
  not have this problem because it already revealed text through
  `nextStreamingText`. Sharing that hook is the fix; no transport change was
  needed.
- AC-1/AC-2/AC-3/AC-4/AC-5/AC-6: live Studio run against two real `qodercli`
  lanes reported two top-level regions (`live-compare-composer`, then the lanes),
  zero headings inside the view, 18 distinct reveal steps across one turn where
  the previous build produced a handful, `0 tool calls · 1 message` per lane
  header, a lane list still pinned to the bottom, and no console or page errors.
- AC-8: `@qoder-ai/harness-studio` typecheck plus 544 unit tests pass. The
  live-compare Playwright test passes against the reduced DOM. Layouts verified
  at 1440x900, 1024x768, and 390x844 with `documentWidth === innerWidth` at each
  and two lanes retained at every width.
- AC-7: `cargo +1.96.0 test` for `harness-acp-host` passes 61 unit and 14
  integration tests, including the new bounded-tail unit tests and a
  `connection.open` against an agent that writes to stderr and exits, whose
  reported `call-failed` message carries that stderr.
- Pre-existing failures not caused by this change: seven Studio browser tests
  fail in the current working tree from earlier uncommitted Debugger and shell
  work. Five assert `ownedStyleSheets === 3` while `index.html` now links a fourth
  sheet (`live-composer.css`); two assert Debugger chrome text and a
  `button.primary` that the shell rework moved. None touch the Compare surface.
