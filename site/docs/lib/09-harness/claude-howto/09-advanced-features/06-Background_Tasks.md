## Background Tasks

Background tasks allow long-running operations to execute without blocking your conversation.

### What Are Background Tasks?

Background tasks run asynchronously while you continue working:
- Long test suites
- Build processes
- Database migrations
- Deployment scripts
- Analysis tools

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
User: Run tests in background

Claude: Started task bg-1234

/task list           # Show all tasks
/task status bg-1234 # Check progress
/task show bg-1234   # View output
/task cancel bg-1234 # Cancel task
```

### Starting Background Tasks

```
User: Run the full test suite in the background

Claude: Starting tests in background (task-id: bg-1234)
You can continue working while tests run.

[You can continue the conversation]

User: Meanwhile, let's refactor the auth module

Claude: [Works on auth module while tests run in background]

[Later, when tests complete]

Claude: 📢 Background task bg-1234 completed:
✅ 245 tests passed
❌ 3 tests failed
View results: /task show bg-1234
```

### Managing Background Tasks

**List active tasks**:
```
User: /task list

Active background tasks:
1. [bg-1234] Running tests (50% complete, 2min remaining)
2. [bg-1235] Building Docker image (25% complete, 8min remaining)
3. [bg-1236] Deploying to staging (90% complete, 30sec remaining)
```

**Check task status**:
```
User: /task status bg-1234

Task bg-1234: Running tests
Status: In progress
Progress: 120/245 tests (49%)
Started: 2025-11-08 10:30:15
Estimated completion: 2025-11-08 10:34:22
```

**View task output**:
```
User: /task show bg-1234

[Shows live output from the test run]
```

**Cancel task**:
```
User: /task cancel bg-1234

Cancelled background task bg-1234
```

### Example: Parallel Development

```
User: Run the build in the background

Claude: Starting build... (task-id: bg-5001)

User: Also run the linter in background

Claude: Starting linter... (task-id: bg-5002)

User: While those run, let's implement the new API endpoint

Claude: [Implements API endpoint while build and linter run]

[10 minutes later]

Claude: 📢 Build completed successfully (bg-5001)
📢 Linter found 12 issues (bg-5002)

User: Show me the linter issues

Claude: [Shows linter output from bg-5002]
```

### Configuration

There is no `settings.json` block for background tasks. The feature is controlled by an environment variable:

```bash
# Turn background tasks off entirely
export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=true
```

Concurrency is not a background-task setting either — how many agents run at once is governed by `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` (default `20`).
