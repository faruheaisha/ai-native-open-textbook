# Extend Claude with skills

> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom commands and bundled skills.

Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.

Create a skill when you keep pasting the same instructions, checklist, or multi-step procedure into chat, or when a section of CLAUDE.md has grown into a procedure rather than a fact. Unlike CLAUDE.md content, a skill's body loads only when it's used, so long reference material costs almost nothing until you need it.

  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, and bundled skills like `/debug` and `/code-review`, see the [commands reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands).

  **Custom commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.

Claude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context). See [Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code](#using-skill-frontmatter-outside-claude-code) for which frontmatter fields are part of the standard and which are Claude Code extensions.
