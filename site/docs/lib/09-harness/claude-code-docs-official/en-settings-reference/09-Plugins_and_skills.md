## Plugins and skills

Enable plugins, register marketplaces, restrict which plugin sources an organization allows, and control which skills load. For installing and building plugins, see [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).

### `disableBundledSkills`

Turn off the [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and workflows included with Claude Code. Claude Code removes bundled skills and workflows entirely, while built-in commands such as `/init` stay typable but are hidden from the model.

* **Scope**: [`Any file`](#scopes)
* **Type**: Boolean
  * `true`: Claude Code removes bundled skills and workflows and hides built-in commands such as `/init` from the model
  * `false`: bundled skills load
* **Default**: unset, so bundled skills load
* **Per-session overrides**: [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars) set to `1` turns bundled skills off for one session; whichever of the two turns them off, the other can't turn them back on

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "disableBundledSkills": true
}
```

Skills from plugins, `.claude/skills/`, and `.claude/commands/` are unaffected. `/doctor` stays typable like the built-in commands; to hide it, set [`DISABLE_DOCTOR_COMMAND`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars) instead.

### `disableSkillShellExecution`

Turn off inline shell execution for `` !`...` `` and ` ```! ` blocks in [skills](https://code.claude.com/en/skills) and custom commands from user, project, plugin, or additional-directory sources. Claude Code replaces each command with `[shell command execution disabled by policy]` instead of running it.

* **Scope**: [`Any file`](#scopes). A `true` in managed settings can't be overridden by `false` elsewhere.
* **Type**: Boolean
  * `true`: Claude Code replaces each inline shell command with `[shell command execution disabled by policy]` instead of running it
  * `false`: inline shell runs
* **Default**: unset, so inline shell runs

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "disableSkillShellExecution": true
}
```

Bundled skills and skills deployed through managed settings are unaffected.

### `skillOverrides`

Hide or collapse a [skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#override-skill-visibility-from-settings) without editing its `SKILL.md`. Claude Code applies the value under each skill's name to the skill list Claude sees and to your `/` autocomplete.

* **Scope**: [`Any file`](#scopes). The `/skills` menu writes to `.claude/settings.local.json`.
* **Type**: object mapping skill name to one of:
  * `"on"`: Claude sees the skill and you can type `/name`
  * `"name-only"`: Claude sees the skill by name without its description
  * `"user-invocable-only"`: Claude doesn't see the skill, but you can still type `/name`
  * `"off"`: Claude doesn't see the skill and `/name` is hidden from autocomplete
* **Default**: unset, so every skill is `"on"`

This example lists `legacy-context` to Claude by name only and hides `deploy` from Claude and from `/` autocomplete:

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "skillOverrides": {
    "legacy-context": "name-only",
    "deploy": "off"
  }
}
```

Overrides don't apply to plugin skills, which you manage through `/plugin`.

In managed settings and files passed with `--settings`, a key on a bundled skill's alias, such as `checkup` for `/doctor`, also applies to the skill; see [how alias keys combine with keys on the skill's own name](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#override-skill-visibility-from-settings).

### `syncClaudeAiSkills`

Turn off the download of the [skills you enable on claude.ai](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#how-synced-skills-behave). Claude Code downloads them into `~/.claude/skills/synced/` when you run it in [non-interactive mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag and [`CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars#variables) set. Set `false` to stop that download and hide the skills it already synced. Claude Code honors only `false`: `true` is the same as unset and doesn't turn syncing on.

* **Scope**: [`User, local, or managed`](#scopes). A repository can't turn it off for you.
* **Type**: Boolean
  * `false`: Claude Code stops downloading synced skills and hides the ones already in `~/.claude/skills/synced/`. In user or managed settings, it also moves them to `~/.claude/skills/.trash/`
  * `true`: the same as unset
* **Default**: unset, so a non-interactive run with `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS` set downloads the skills

This example keeps a machine from downloading the account's skills, whatever a session sets in its environment:

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "syncClaudeAiSkills": false
}
```

### `allowedChannelPlugins`

Choose which [channel](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels) plugins can push messages into sessions in your organization. When you set it, Claude Code uses your list in place of the default Anthropic allowlist; each entry names a plugin and the marketplace it comes from.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: array of objects, each with `marketplace` and `plugin` strings. An entry can instead be a `"plugin@marketplace"` string such as `"telegram@claude-plugins-official"`, which Claude Code treats as the equivalent object. The string form requires Claude Code v2.1.267 or later; earlier versions reject the whole `allowedChannelPlugins` value when it contains one
* **Default**: unset, so Claude Code uses the default Anthropic allowlist

This example turns channels on and allows only the Telegram plugin from the official Anthropic marketplace:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "channelsEnabled": true,
  "allowedChannelPlugins": [
    { "marketplace": "claude-plugins-official", "plugin": "telegram" }
  ]
}
```

An empty array blocks every channel plugin.

This key takes effect once channels pass the [`channelsEnabled`](#channelsenabled) gate for the account: on Team and Enterprise plans, and on Console accounts with managed settings, that means `channelsEnabled: true`. See [Restrict which channel plugins can run](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels#restrict-which-channel-plugins-can-run).

### `blockedMarketplaces`

Block plugin marketplace sources for your organization. Claude Code checks the blocklist on marketplace add and on plugin install, update, refresh, and auto-update, so a marketplace someone added before you set the policy can't be used to fetch plugins either. Blocked sources are checked before download, so they never touch the filesystem.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: array of marketplace source objects, in the same forms as [`strictKnownMarketplaces`](#allowed-source-types)
* **Default**: unset, so no marketplace is blocked

This example blocks one GitHub repository as a marketplace source:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "blockedMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "untrusted/plugins" }
  ]
}
```

A `github` entry may use the [owner-wildcard form](#owner-wildcards) `"owner/*"` to block every repository under that GitHub owner, which requires Claude Code v2.1.223 or later. Add `\{ "source": "skills-dir" \}` to stop Claude Code loading [`@skills-dir` plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#skills-directory-plugins) from `~/.claude/skills/` without restricting any marketplace. See [Managed marketplace restrictions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions).

### `channelsEnabled`

Allow [channels](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels) for your organization. On claude.ai Team and Enterprise plans, Claude Code blocks channels until you set this to `true`. For [Anthropic Console](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#claude-console-authentication) accounts that authenticate with an API key, channels are allowed by default. If your organization deploys managed settings, Claude Code blocks channels on those accounts too until you set this key to `true`.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: Boolean
  * `true`: Claude Code allows channels for your organization
  * `false`: the same as unset; whether channels are blocked depends on your plan, as the Default says
* **Default**: unset; channels are blocked on Team and Enterprise plans and on Console accounts with managed settings, and allowed on Pro and Max plans and on Console accounts without managed settings

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "channelsEnabled": true
}
```

To restrict which plugins can register as channels once they're enabled, set [`allowedChannelPlugins`](#allowedchannelplugins). See [Enterprise controls](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels#enterprise-controls).

### `disableCommandPluginSources`

Block the [`command` plugin source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#command-sources), which installs a plugin by running a marketplace-declared command on the user's machine. When you set it to `true`, Claude Code never runs the command, doesn't install or update command-sourced plugins, and stops loading the ones already installed. Set it to `false` to allow them explicitly. Whenever it blocks command sources, whether you set it to `true` or leave it unset under [`allowManagedHooksOnly`](#allowmanagedhooksonly), it also blocks marketplace [`headersHelper` commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#authenticate-archive-downloads), except for a marketplace that managed settings themselves declare. Requires Claude Code v2.1.229 or later, and the `headersHelper` block requires v2.1.238 or later.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: Boolean
  * `true`: Claude Code never runs the marketplace-declared command, doesn't install or update command-sourced plugins, and stops loading the ones already installed
  * `false`: Claude Code allows command-sourced plugins explicitly
* **Default**: unset, so Claude Code follows [`allowManagedHooksOnly`](#allowmanagedhooksonly): an organization that restricts hook execution to managed settings gets command sources disabled too

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "disableCommandPluginSources": true
}
```

Requires Claude Code v2.1.229 or later.

### `pluginSuggestionMarketplaces`

Name the marketplaces whose plugins can appear as contextual install suggestions, in spinner tips and pinned at the top of the `/plugin` **Discover** tab. The built-in first-party frontend-design tip is unaffected. Suggestions come from each plugin's `relevance` declaration in its marketplace entry.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: array of marketplace names
* **Default**: unset, so no marketplace-declared suggestions surface

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "pluginSuggestionMarketplaces": ["acme-corp-plugins"]
}
```

A name takes effect only when the marketplace is registered on the machine and its registered source is also declared in the same managed settings, either as the [`extraKnownMarketplaces`](#extraknownmarketplaces) entry for that name or as an entry of [`strictKnownMarketplaces`](#strictknownmarketplaces). Claude Code ignores a marketplace registered from a different source under an allowlisted name. The official marketplace is exempt from the source requirement: allowlisting its name alone suffices, since that name can only register from the official Anthropic source. See [Suggest plugins by context](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-relevance).

### `pluginTrustMessage`

Add your organization's own text to the plugin trust warning Claude Code shows before installation, for example to confirm that plugins from your internal marketplace are vetted.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: string
* **Default**: unset, so Claude Code shows the standard warning alone

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "pluginTrustMessage": "All plugins from our marketplace are approved by IT"
}
```

### `strictKnownMarketplaces`

Restrict which plugin marketplace sources people in your organization can add and install plugins from. Claude Code enforces the allowlist on marketplace add and on plugin install, update, refresh, and auto-update, before any network or filesystem operation, so a marketplace someone added before you set the policy can't be used to fetch plugins once its source no longer matches. Blocked users see an error naming the managed policy.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: array of marketplace source objects; see [Allowed source types](#allowed-source-types)
* **Default**: unset, so users can add any marketplace. An empty array is a complete lockdown that blocks every marketplace source, including the official Anthropic marketplace

This example allows two GitHub repositories, one pinned to the `v2.0` ref, and one hosted `marketplace.json` URL:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins" },
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools", "ref": "v2.0" },
    { "source": "url", "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json" }
  ]
}
```

You can also write this key as `allowedMarketplaces`; [Marketplace key aliases](#marketplace-key-aliases) describes how Claude Code treats the alias and which version accepts it. This key is a policy gate: it controls what users may add but registers nothing. To restrict and pre-register in one file, see [Combine with `extraKnownMarketplaces`](#combine-with-extraknownmarketplaces). For the user-facing view, see [Managed marketplace restrictions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions).

#### Allowed source types

Each entry below shows one allowlist entry per source type and the fields it accepts. Most types match exactly; `hostPattern` and `pathPattern` match by regex, and `github` entries can use an [owner wildcard](#owner-wildcards).

| Source        | Example entry                                                                                                                   | Fields                                                                                         |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github`      | `\{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main", "path": "marketplace" \}`                                     | `repo` required; `ref` is a branch or tag; `path` is a subdirectory                            |
| `git`         | `\{ "source": "git", "url": "https://gitlab.example.com/tools/plugins.git", "ref": "production" \}`                               | `url` required; `ref` and `path` as for `github`                                               |
| `url`         | `\{ "source": "url", "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json", "headers": \{ "Authorization": "Bearer ${TOKEN}" } }` | `url` required; `headers` adds HTTP headers for authenticated access                           |
| `npm`         | `{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/claude-plugins" }`                                                                   | `package` required, the npm package that contains `marketplace.json`                           |
| `file`        | `{ "source": "file", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/plugins/marketplace.json" }`                                                       | `path` required, the absolute path to a `marketplace.json` file                                |
| `directory`   | `{ "source": "directory", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/approved-marketplaces" }`                                                     | `path` required, the absolute path to a directory containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` |
| `hostPattern` | `{ "source": "hostPattern", "hostPattern": "^github\\.example\\.com$" \}`                                                        | `hostPattern` required, a regex matched against the marketplace host                           |
| `pathPattern` | `\{ "source": "pathPattern", "pathPattern": "^/opt/approved/" \}`                                                                 | `pathPattern` required, a regex matched against the `path` of `file` and `directory` sources   |
| `skills-dir`  | `\{ "source": "skills-dir" \}`                                                                                                    | No fields. Opts the `~/.claude/skills/` plugin scan back in                                    |

Three source types carry rules beyond the table:

* **`url`**: a URL marketplace downloads only the `marketplace.json` file, and Claude Code doesn't fetch plugin files by relative path from that server, so its plugins must use a [plugin source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugin-sources) other than a relative path, such as an archive URL, which can be on the same host. For plugins with relative paths, use a Git-based marketplace instead. See [Plugins with relative paths fail in URL-based marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces).
* **`hostPattern`**: use it to allow every marketplace on an internal GitHub Enterprise or GitLab server without listing each repository. Claude Code matches `github` sources against `github.com`, takes the hostname from `url` sources, and takes it from `git` sources depending on the [git URL](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls)'s form:

  * A URL with a scheme, such as `https://` or `ssh://`: the hostname in the URL.
  * An SSH address without a scheme, in git's `user@host:path` form, such as `git@git.example.com:tools/plugins.git`: the host between `@` and `:`, which is the host git connects to.
  * Any other form without a scheme: no host, so no `strictKnownMarketplaces` `hostPattern` entry matches it. For a `blockedMarketplaces` `hostPattern`, Claude Code takes a host from a wider set of forms, so a blocklist entry can still match such a form. Before v2.1.234, a `strictKnownMarketplaces` `hostPattern` also matched some forms that git doesn't treat as SSH addresses.

  `file` and `directory` sources have no host and never match a `hostPattern` entry.
* **`pathPattern`**: use it to allow filesystem marketplaces alongside `hostPattern` entries for network sources. `".*"` allows every local path; a narrower pattern such as `"^/opt/approved/"` restricts to a directory.

Any allowlist, even an empty one, also stops Claude Code loading [`@skills-dir` plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#skills-directory-plugins) from `~/.claude/skills/`. Add the `\{ "source": "skills-dir" \}` entry to keep loading them; the entry has no meaning outside this key and `blockedMarketplaces`.

#### Owner wildcards

A `github` entry whose `repo` value is `"<owner>/*"` matches every repository under that GitHub owner. Owner wildcards require Claude Code v2.1.223 or later and work only in `strictKnownMarketplaces` and `blockedMarketplaces`. Everywhere else a `github` source appears, such as `extraKnownMarketplaces` or `/plugin marketplace add`, the `repo` value must name a single repository. Before v2.1.223, Claude Code compared the entry literally, so an allowlist entry matched no repository and a blocklist entry blocked nothing; single-repository entries are enforced on every version.

This entry allows any marketplace repository in the `acme-corp` organization:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/*" }
  ]
}
```

Only the whole repository-name position can be a wildcard. Claude Code compares entries such as `*`, `*/plugins`, or `acme-corp/tools-*` literally, so they match no repository.

The matching rules differ between the two settings:

| Rule                      | `strictKnownMarketplaces`                                                                                                                                             | `blockedMarketplaces`                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Matching source spellings | `owner/repo` form only. A git URL that clones the same repository doesn't match                                                                                       | Any spelling, including git URLs that resolve to the same github.com repository |
| Owner case                | Case-sensitive, like exact-entry matching                                                                                                                             | Case-insensitive                                                                |
| `ref`                     | Follows the exact-entry rules: an entry with a `ref` matches only sources with that exact ref, and an entry without one matches only sources that don't specify a ref | An entry without a `ref` blocks all refs of the repositories it matches         |
| `path`                    | Looser than the exact-entry rules: an entry with a `path` requires that exact value, while an entry without one matches any path inside the repository                | An entry without a `path` blocks all paths of the repositories it matches       |

#### Exact matching

For every source type except owner-wildcard `github` entries and the regex-matched `hostPattern` and `pathPattern` entries, Claude Code allows a user's addition only when the marketplace source matches an entry exactly. For the git-based sources `github` and `git`, exact matching includes the optional fields:

* The `repo` or `url` must match exactly
* The `ref` field must match exactly, or both must be undefined
* The `path` field must match exactly, or both must be undefined

For example, Claude Code treats each pair below as two different sources:

* `\{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" \}` and `\{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main" \}`
* `\{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "path": "marketplace" \}` and `\{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" \}`

#### Allow only the official marketplace

To allow the official Anthropic marketplace and nothing else, list its repository:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "anthropics/claude-plugins-official" }
  ]
}
```

With this entry, Claude Code keeps an already-registered official marketplace available and, on a fresh machine, registers the marketplace automatically the first time you start Claude Code interactively. Automatic registration most commonly misses:

* Non-interactive environments that run before the machine's first interactive launch.
* Machines where Claude Code already ran interactively under a policy that blocked the marketplace, such as the empty-array lockdown. Claude Code records the blocked attempt and doesn't retry after the policy changes.

On these machines, add the marketplace to [`extraKnownMarketplaces`](#extraknownmarketplaces) in the same `managed-settings.json` so Claude Code registers it automatically, or run `claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official`.

#### Combine with `extraKnownMarketplaces`

The two keys do different jobs. This table compares them:

| Aspect            | `strictKnownMarketplaces`                | `extraKnownMarketplaces`                                                                             |

To both restrict and pre-register a marketplace for all users, set both in `managed-settings.json`:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
  ],
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
    }
  }
}
```

With only `strictKnownMarketplaces` set, users can still add an allowed marketplace themselves with `/plugin marketplace add`. The official Anthropic marketplace is the only one Claude Code registers automatically, and only when the allowlist allows it. [Allow only the official marketplace](#allow-only-the-official-marketplace) lists the machines it misses.

### `strictPluginOnlyCustomization`

Block skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers from user and project sources, so they can come only from plugins or managed settings. Combine it with [`strictKnownMarketplaces`](#strictknownmarketplaces) to control the full customization supply chain: the marketplace allowlist controls which plugins users can install.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: `true` to lock all four kinds of customization, or an array naming the kinds to lock, from `"skills"`, `"agents"`, `"hooks"`, and `"mcp"`
* **Default**: unset, so nothing is locked

This example locks skills and hooks and leaves agents and MCP servers unlocked:

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictPluginOnlyCustomization": ["skills", "hooks"]
}
```

The four sub-key entries below list what each surface blocks and what still loads. Claude Code ignores surface names it doesn't recognize rather than failing the settings file, so you can add new surface names before every client has updated.

### `strictPluginOnlyCustomization.skills`

Lock the `skills` surface. Claude Code stops loading skills from `~/.claude/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`, custom commands from `~/.claude/commands/` and `.claude/commands/`, skills under `--add-dir` directories, and skills synced from your claude.ai account, and keeps loading plugin skills, bundled skills, and skills in the managed policy directory.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: the string `"skills"` in the [`strictPluginOnlyCustomization`](#strictpluginonlycustomization) array
* **Default**: not locked

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictPluginOnlyCustomization": ["skills"]
}
```

### `strictPluginOnlyCustomization.agents`

Lock the `agents` surface. Claude Code stops loading agents from `~/.claude/agents/` and `.claude/agents/`, and keeps loading plugin agents, built-in agents, and agents in the managed policy directory.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: the string `"agents"` in the [`strictPluginOnlyCustomization`](#strictpluginonlycustomization) array
* **Default**: not locked

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictPluginOnlyCustomization": ["agents"]
}
```

### `strictPluginOnlyCustomization.hooks`

Lock the `hooks` surface. Claude Code stops running hooks from user, project, and local `settings.json`, and keeps running plugin hooks and hooks in managed settings.

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: the string `"hooks"` in the [`strictPluginOnlyCustomization`](#strictpluginonlycustomization) array
* **Default**: not locked

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictPluginOnlyCustomization": ["hooks"]
}
```

### `strictPluginOnlyCustomization.mcp`

Lock the `mcp` surface. Claude Code stops loading MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` and `.mcp.json`, and keeps loading plugin MCP servers, [`managed-mcp.json`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/managed-mcp) servers, and servers from [`managedMcpServers`](#managedmcpservers).

* **Scope**: [`Managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: the string `"mcp"` in the [`strictPluginOnlyCustomization`](#strictpluginonlycustomization) array
* **Default**: not locked

```json managed-settings.json theme={null}
{
  "strictPluginOnlyCustomization": ["mcp"]
}
```

### `enabledPlugins`

Turn individual [plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) on or off, keyed by `plugin-name@marketplace-name`. A plugin with no entry at any scope falls back to its [`defaultEnabled`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#default-enablement) value. When you enable or disable a plugin with `/plugin` or `claude plugin enable`, Claude Code writes this key for you.

* **Scope**: [`Any file`](#scopes)
* **Type**: object mapping `plugin-name@marketplace-name` to a Boolean
* **Default**: unset, so each plugin follows its `defaultEnabled` value

This example enables two plugins from the `team-tools` marketplace and disables one from `personal`:

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@team-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@team-tools": true,
    "experimental-features@personal": false
  }
}
```

Each scope serves a different purpose:

* **User settings**: your personal plugin preferences
* **Project settings**: plugins shared with everyone in the repository
* **Local settings**: per-machine overrides, gitignored when Claude Code saves a setting there
* **Managed settings**: organization-wide policy. A plugin set to `false` here is blocked from installation at every scope and hidden from the marketplace

Project settings take precedence over user settings, so setting a plugin to `false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` doesn't disable a plugin that the project's `.claude/settings.json` enables. To opt out of a project-enabled plugin on your machine, set it to `false` in `.claude/settings.local.json` instead. Plugins force-enabled by managed settings can't be disabled this way, since managed settings override local settings.

Enabling a plugin from an external source such as a GitHub repository or npm package in a project's `.claude/settings.json` doesn't install it for other people. On every path that loads plugins, Claude Code reports the plugin as not installed until each user [installs it themselves](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#configure-team-marketplaces).

### `extraKnownMarketplaces`

Register additional plugin marketplaces by name, so that people who open the repository, or everyone your managed settings reach, get the marketplace without adding it themselves. Claude Code registers each marketplace it doesn't already know. Whether a plugin that [`enabledPlugins`](#enabledplugins) names from it installs depends on the plugin's source and which file enables it; that entry has the rules.

* **Scope**: [`Any file`](#scopes). Claude Code honors entries in a repository's `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` only after you accept the workspace trust dialog for that folder; in a folder you haven't trusted, including a `-p` run there, it ignores them without a message.
* **Type**: object mapping a marketplace name to an object with a `source` object and an optional `autoUpdate` Boolean
* **Default**: unset

This example registers a GitHub marketplace and a marketplace from a self-hosted git URL:

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
      }
    },
    "security-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "git",
        "url": "https://git.example.com/security/plugins.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

[What runs before you trust a folder](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#what-runs-before-you-trust-a-folder) compares the trust gate with the other content a repository can supply. You can also write this key as `additionalMarketplaces`; see [Marketplace key aliases](#marketplace-key-aliases).

Set `"autoUpdate": true` alongside `source` to make Claude Code refresh that marketplace and update its installed plugins in the background after startup. When omitted, `claude-plugins-official` and most other official Anthropic marketplaces default to `true`, and third-party marketplaces default to `false`. See [Configure auto-updates](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#configure-auto-updates).

When more than one settings file defines a marketplace entry under the same name, Claude Code uses the entry from the [highest-precedence file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence) whole. That entry replaces the lower-precedence entry and inherits none of its fields, so a redefinition can't combine one file's `source.headers` credential with a URL another file controls. Before v2.1.228, Claude Code merged same-name entries field by field, so an entry in a higher-precedence file could inherit fields it didn't set, including another file's `headers`.

#### Marketplace source types

The `source` object takes one of these forms:

* **`github`**: a GitHub repository, with `repo`
* **`git`**: any git URL, with `url`
* **`url`**: a direct URL to a `marketplace.json` file, with `url` and optional `headers` and `headersHelper` for authenticated access. `headersHelper` names a command that prints headers whose values are too short-lived to list in `headers`, and requires Claude Code v2.1.238 or later
* **`file`**: a local path to a `marketplace.json` file, with `path`
* **`directory`**: a local filesystem path, with `path`, for development only
* **`settings`**: an inline marketplace declared directly in the settings file without a hosted repository, with `name` and `plugins`

The `git` source type works with any git hosting service, including self-hosted GitLab and Bitbucket. Claude Code clones the repository with the same authentication that `git clone` would use on that machine: configured credential helpers or SSH keys. A provider token such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` takes effect only through a credential helper that reads it. See [Private repositories](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#private-repositories) for setup details.

For `github` and `git` sources, set `"skipLfs": true` inside the `source` object, alongside `repo` or `url`, to skip Git LFS downloads when Claude Code clones or updates the marketplace repository. LFS pointer files remain as pointers instead of downloading their content. Use this when the repository contains large LFS objects unrelated to plugin content.

For a `url` source, set `headersHelper` inside the `source` object when the credential in `headers` expires and a command has to produce a fresh one. Requires Claude Code v2.1.238 or later. For what the command must print and where Claude Code runs it, see [Write the headersHelper command](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#write-the-headershelper-command), and for the cases where Claude Code doesn't run it, see [When Claude Code skips a headersHelper command](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#when-claude-code-skips-a-headershelper-command-or-drops-its-output). Once you set `headersHelper` on an `https://` marketplace URL, Claude Code runs the command at two points, reusing one run's output for up to 60 seconds:

* Before each fetch of that marketplace's `marketplace.json`, including a later refresh. Claude Code sends the printed headers with that fetch.
* Before each plugin archive download on the marketplace URL's origin, meaning the same scheme, host, and port. Claude Code sends the output with that download, and no other download gets the headers.

Claude Code ignores any `headersHelper` set in the `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` of a directory you add with [`--add-dir`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#what-runs-before-you-trust-a-folder), on a `url` source and on an inline plugin entry alike, and sends only the fixed `headers` set in that file. [How users accept a headersHelper command](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#how-users-accept-a-headershelper-command) covers the other settings files.

Plugins listed in a `settings` source must reference external sources such as GitHub or npm, and the `name` must match the marketplace key. You still enable each plugin separately in `enabledPlugins`. This example declares one plugin inline:

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "team-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "settings",
        "name": "team-tools",
        "plugins": [
          {
            "name": "code-formatter",
            "source": {
              "source": "github",
              "repo": "acme-corp/code-formatter"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A plugin entry under `source: 'settings'` whose own `source` is an [`archive`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#zip-archives) can set `headers` for the archive download. If the value you would put in `headers` is short-lived, such as a token your registry mints on request, set a `headersHelper` command instead. An entry may set both. Both fields require Claude Code v2.1.238 or later.

Claude Code sends the entry's `headers`, and whatever the command prints, with that plugin's archive download and with no other download. Claude Code runs the command only when a user [installs or updates that one plugin by itself](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#how-users-accept-a-headershelper-command). Three further rules depend on which file holds the entry:

* **`strict`**: unlike an entry in a marketplace's `marketplace.json`, an entry in settings doesn't need `"strict": false`, because a settings file carries no manifest fields to inline. See [Strict mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#strict-mode).
* **Folder trust**: for an entry in a project's `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`, Claude Code runs the command only after the user has also [trusted that folder](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#what-runs-before-you-trust-a-folder).
* **Header filter**: Claude Code drops [request-routing and client-identity header names](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#when-claude-code-skips-a-headershelper-command-or-drops-its-output) from an entry in a project's `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`, because a repository can supply those files. Claude Code applies the same filter to a catalog entry and to an entry in an `--add-dir` directory's settings, and no filter to an entry in your user settings, a `--settings` file, or managed settings.

#### Marketplace key aliases

On Claude Code v2.1.232 or later, you can write `extraKnownMarketplaces` as `additionalMarketplaces` and `strictKnownMarketplaces` as `allowedMarketplaces`. Claude Code treats each alias as follows:

* Earlier versions ignore the alias, so keep the canonical spelling in a file that older versions also read, such as a managed settings file for a fleet with mixed Claude Code versions.
* In any settings file that accepts the canonical key, Claude Code reads the alias exactly as it reads the canonical key.
* Claude Code may rewrite `additionalMarketplaces` to `extraKnownMarketplaces` when it updates the file.
* If you set both spellings in one file, Claude Code uses the canonical value and ignores the alias.

### `pluginConfigs`

Store the non-sensitive answers you give a plugin's [`userConfig`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#user-configuration) configuration dialog, keyed by plugin ID. Claude Code writes this key to your user settings when you fill in the dialog, so you don't need to edit it by hand. Claude Code stores sensitive options in the macOS Keychain instead, falling back to `~/.claude/.credentials.json` when the Keychain rejects the write; on platforms without a supported keychain, it stores them in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.

* **Scope**: [`User or managed`](#scopes)
* **Type**: object mapping a plugin ID to an object with an `options` field, mapping each option name to a string, number, Boolean, or array of strings, and an optional `mcpServers` field holding per-server user configuration values in the same shape
* **Default**: unset

This example stores the `api_endpoint` option for the `deployer` plugin from `acme-tools`:

```json settings.json theme={null}
{
  "pluginConfigs": {
    "deployer@acme-tools": {
      "options": {
        "api_endpoint": "https://api.example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code ignores project and local entries because it substitutes these values into plugin hook, MCP, and LSP configurations, and a cloned repository must not be able to supply them. Before v2.1.207, project and local settings were also read.
