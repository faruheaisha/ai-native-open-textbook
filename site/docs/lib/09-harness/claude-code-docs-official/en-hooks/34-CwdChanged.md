### CwdChanged

Runs when a shell command in the main conversation changes the working directory, for example when Claude executes a `cd` command. Use this to react to directory changes: reload environment variables, activate project-specific toolchains, or run setup scripts automatically. Pairs with [FileChanged](#filechanged) for tools like [direnv](https://direnv.net/) that manage per-directory environment.

CwdChanged hooks have access to [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`](#persist-environment-variables). Variables written to that file persist into subsequent Bash commands until the next CwdChanged event, when Claude Code clears them.

CwdChanged doesn't support matchers and fires on every occurrence.

#### CwdChanged input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), CwdChanged hooks receive `old_cwd` and `new_cwd`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/my-project/src",
  "hook_event_name": "CwdChanged",
  "old_cwd": "/Users/my-project",
  "new_cwd": "/Users/my-project/src"
}
```

#### CwdChanged output

In addition to the [JSON output fields](#json-output) available to all hooks, CwdChanged hooks can return `watchPaths` to dynamically set which file paths [FileChanged](#filechanged) watches:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `watchPaths` | Array of absolute paths. Replaces the current dynamic watch list. Paths from your `matcher` configuration are always watched. Returning an empty array clears the dynamic list, which is typical when entering a new directory |

CwdChanged hooks have no decision control. They can't block the directory change.

Claude Code reads `watchPaths` and `systemMessage` from their JSON output and discards `continue`. In interactive sessions, it shows the `systemMessage` as a brief terminal notification. The message doesn't reach the SDK message stream.
