### PostToolBatch

Runs once after every tool call in a batch has resolved, before Claude Code sends the next request to the model. `PostToolUse` fires once per tool, which means it fires concurrently when Claude makes parallel tool calls. `PostToolBatch` fires exactly once with the full batch, so it is the right place to inject context that depends on the set of tools that ran rather than on any single tool. There is no matcher for this event.

#### PostToolBatch input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), PostToolBatch hooks receive `tool_calls`, an array describing every tool call in the batch:

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "PostToolBatch",
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "tool_name": "Read",
      "tool_input": {"file_path": "/.../ledger/accounts.py"},
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01...",
      "tool_response": "     1\tfrom __future__ import annotations\n     2\t..."
    },
    {
      "tool_name": "Read",
      "tool_input": {"file_path": "/.../ledger/transactions.py"},
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_02...",
      "tool_response": "     1\tfrom __future__ import annotations\n     2\t..."
    }
  ]
}
```

`tool_response` contains the same content the model receives in the corresponding `tool_result` block. The value is a serialized string or content-block array, exactly as the tool emitted it. For `Read`, that means line-number-prefixed text rather than raw file contents. Responses can be large, so parse only the fields you need.

  The `tool_response` shape differs from `PostToolUse`'s. `PostToolUse` passes the tool's structured `Output` object, such as `\{filePath: "...", type: "create"\}` for `Write`; `PostToolBatch` passes the serialized `tool_result` content the model sees.

#### PostToolBatch decision control

`PostToolBatch` hooks can inject context for Claude. In addition to the [JSON output fields](#json-output) available to all hooks, your hook script can return these event-specific fields:

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `additionalContext` | Context string injected once before the next model call. See [Add context for Claude](#add-context-for-claude) for delivery details, what to put in it, and how resumed sessions handle past values |

```json theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolBatch",
    "additionalContext": "These files are part of the ledger module. Run pytest before marking the task complete."
  }
}
```

Returning `decision: "block"` or `continue: false` stops the agentic loop before the next model call. The blocking message comes from the JSON `reason` or `stopReason`, or from stderr on exit 2. You see it as a warning in the transcript, and it stays in the conversation, so Claude sees it when the conversation continues.
