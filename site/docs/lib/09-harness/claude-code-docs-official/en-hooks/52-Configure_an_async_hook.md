### Configure an async hook

Add `"async": true` to a command hook's configuration to run it in the background without blocking Claude. This field is only available on `type: "command"` hooks.

This hook runs a test script after every `Write` tool call. Claude continues working immediately while `run-tests.sh` executes. When the script finishes, its output is delivered on the next conversation turn:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/run-tests.sh",
            "async": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Once an async hook is running in the background, Claude Code doesn't enforce `timeout` on it. Claude Code still enforces `timeout` on a hook you run with `asyncRewake`.

Claude Code delivers an async hook's results only while the session runs:

* In [non-interactive mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag, Claude Code kills any async hook still running at teardown and finalizes it with outcome `cancelled`
* If your hook's work must outlive a `claude -p` session, start a fully detached process from it
