### FileChanged

Runs when a watched file changes on disk. Claude Code detects changes with a filesystem watcher, not by inspecting tool calls, so it runs the hook no matter what changed the file: an `Edit` or `Write` tool call, a script Claude runs with `Bash`, or a process outside Claude Code entirely. A common use is reloading environment variables when project configuration files change.

The `matcher` for this event serves two roles:

* **Build the watch list**: the value is split on `|` and each segment is registered as a literal filename in the working directory, so `".envrc|.env"` watches exactly those two files. Regex patterns are not useful here: a value like `^\.env` would watch a file literally named `^\.env`.
* **Filter which hooks run**: when a watched file changes, the same value filters which hook groups run using the standard [matcher rules](#matcher-patterns) against the changed file's basename.

This example normalizes line endings in `data.csv` after any change, including a `Bash` command or an external script rewriting the file:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "FileChanged": [
      {
        "matcher": "data.csv",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/normalize-line-endings.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook reads the changed file's absolute path from the `file_path` field of the [JSON input](#filechanged-input) on stdin. Its `grep` guard tests for the same thing `perl` removes, a CR at the end of a line, so the run after a normalization exits without touching the file. A looser guard loops forever, because `perl -i` rewrites the file even when it substitutes nothing and Claude Code runs the hook again after every rewrite. Save this script at `/path/to/normalize-line-endings.sh` and make it executable:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
FILE=$(jq -r .file_path)
if grep -q $'\r$' "$FILE"; then
  perl -pi -e 's/\r$//' "$FILE"
fi
```

To confirm the hook works, ask Claude to append a CRLF line to `data.csv` with a `Bash` command. Claude Code runs the hook and the file ends up with LF endings.

To watch files you can't name up front, return [`watchPaths`](#filechanged-output) from a hook to update the watch list dynamically. Claude Code starts the watcher only when something names a file to watch, so seed the list with a FileChanged group whose matcher names at least one file, or with a [SessionStart](#sessionstart-decision-control) or [CwdChanged](#cwdchanged) hook that returns `watchPaths`. The matcher still filters which hook groups run when a watched file changes, so give the group that handles dynamic paths an omitted matcher, which matches every watched file and adds nothing to the watch list. A `"*"` matcher also matches every file, but Claude Code registers it in the watch list like any other value, as a literal file named `*`.

FileChanged hooks have access to [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`](#persist-environment-variables). Variables written to that file persist into subsequent Bash commands until the next [CwdChanged](#cwdchanged) event, when Claude Code clears them.

#### FileChanged input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), FileChanged hooks receive `file_path` and `event`.

| Field       | Description                                                                                                 |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file_path` | Absolute path to the file that changed                                                                      |
| `event`     | What happened: `"change"` for a modified file, `"add"` for a created file, or `"unlink"` for a deleted file |

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/my-project",
  "hook_event_name": "FileChanged",
  "file_path": "/Users/my-project/.envrc",
  "event": "change"
}
```

#### FileChanged output

In addition to the [JSON output fields](#json-output) available to all hooks, FileChanged hooks can return `watchPaths` to dynamically update which file paths are watched:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `watchPaths` | Array of absolute paths. Replaces the current dynamic watch list. Paths from your `matcher` configuration are always watched. Use this when your hook script discovers additional files to watch based on the changed file |

FileChanged hooks have no decision control. They can't block the file change from occurring.

Claude Code reads `watchPaths` and `systemMessage` from their JSON output and discards `continue`. In interactive sessions, it shows the `systemMessage` as a brief terminal notification. The message doesn't reach the SDK message stream.
