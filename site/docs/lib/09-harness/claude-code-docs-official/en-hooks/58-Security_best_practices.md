### Security best practices

Keep these practices in mind when writing hooks:

* **Validate and sanitize inputs**: never trust input data blindly
* **Always quote shell variables**: use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
* **Block path traversal**: check for `..` in file paths
* **Use absolute paths**: specify full paths for scripts. In exec form, use `$\{CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\}` and the path needs no quoting. In shell form, wrap it in double quotes
* **Skip sensitive files**: avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

## Windows PowerShell tool

On Windows, you can run individual hooks in PowerShell by setting `"shell": "powershell"` on a command hook. Claude Code auto-detects `pwsh.exe`, the PowerShell 7 and later executable, and falls back to `powershell.exe` for Windows PowerShell 5.1.

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "shell": "powershell",
            "command": "Write-Host 'File written'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To reference the project root from a PowerShell shell-form command, write `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` or `$env:CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. As of v2.1.198, Claude Code rewrites the `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT\}`, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` placeholders in a PowerShell shell-form command to PowerShell's `${env:NAME\}` form, whether the hook is defined in `settings.json`, a plugin, or a skill. PowerShell then resolves the value from the exported environment after parsing, so the placeholder works inside double-quoted strings but not inside single-quoted strings, where PowerShell never expands variables.

Before v2.1.198, this rewrite applied only to plugin hooks. On earlier versions, a `settings.json` hook needs the `$env:` form or [exec form](#exec-form-and-shell-form), where `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\}` is substituted in each `args` element regardless of where the hook is defined.

Don't write the bare `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` spelling in a PowerShell hook. PowerShell parses it as an undefined local variable and resolves it to `$null`, which leaves the script path without its project-root prefix. Claude Code doesn't rewrite that form; it logs a warning in the [debug log](#debug-hooks) instead.

The example below shows a `settings.json` hook that runs a project script with the `$env:` form, which works on every version:

```json theme={null}
{
  "type": "command",
  "shell": "powershell",
  "command": "& \"$env:CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\\.claude\\hooks\\check.ps1\""
}
```
