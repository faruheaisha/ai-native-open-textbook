### TeammateIdle

Runs when an [agent team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate is about to go idle after finishing its turn. Use this to enforce quality gates before a teammate stops working, such as requiring passing lint checks or verifying that output files exist.

TeammateIdle hooks don't support matchers and fire on every occurrence.

#### TeammateIdle input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), TeammateIdle hooks receive `teammate_name` and `team_name`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "TeammateIdle",
  "teammate_name": "researcher",
  "team_name": "session-a1b2c3d4"
}
```

| Field           | Description                                                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teammate_name` | Name of the teammate that is about to go idle                              |
| `team_name`     | Deprecated. Session-derived team name; will be removed in a future release |

#### TeammateIdle decision control

TeammateIdle hooks support two ways to control teammate behavior:

* **Exit code 2**: the teammate receives the stderr message as feedback and continues working instead of going idle.
* **JSON `\{"continue": false, "stopReason": "..."\}`**: stops the teammate entirely, matching `Stop` hook behavior. The `stopReason` is shown to the user.

This example checks that a build artifact exists before allowing a teammate to go idle:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -f "./dist/output.js" ]; then
  echo "Build artifact missing. Run the build before stopping." >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```
