### PreCompact

Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation.

The matcher value indicates whether compaction was triggered manually or automatically:

| Matcher  | When it fires                                                                                                      |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manual` | `/compact`                                                                                                         |
| `auto`   | Auto-compact when the conversation reaches the [auto-compact window](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#set-the-auto-compact-window) |

Exit with code 2 to block compaction. For a manual `/compact`, the stderr message is shown to the user. You can also block by returning JSON with `"decision": "block"`.

Blocking automatic compaction has different effects depending on when it fires. If compaction was triggered proactively before the context limit, Claude Code skips it and the conversation continues uncompacted. If compaction was triggered to recover from a context-limit error already returned by the API, the underlying error surfaces and the current request fails.

Claude Code discards a PreCompact hook's `systemMessage` and `continue` fields.

#### PreCompact input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), PreCompact hooks receive `trigger` and `custom_instructions`. For `manual`, `custom_instructions` contains what the user passes into `/compact` and is `null` when they pass nothing. For `auto`, `custom_instructions` is `null`.
