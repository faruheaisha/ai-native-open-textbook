### TaskCompleted

Runs when a task is being marked as completed. This fires in two situations: when any agent explicitly marks a task as completed through the TaskUpdate tool, or when an [agent team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate finishes its turn with in-progress tasks. Use this to enforce completion criteria like passing tests or lint checks before a task can close.

TaskCompleted hooks don't support matchers and fire on every occurrence.

#### TaskCompleted input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), TaskCompleted hooks receive `task_id`, `task_subject`, and optionally `task_description`, `teammate_name`, and `team_name`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "TaskCompleted",
  "task_id": "task-001",
  "task_subject": "Implement user authentication",
  "task_description": "Add login and signup endpoints",
  "teammate_name": "implementer",
  "team_name": "session-a1b2c3d4"
}
```

| Field              | Description                                                                |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_id`          | Identifier of the task being completed                                     |
| `task_subject`     | Title of the task                                                          |
| `task_description` | Detailed description of the task. May be absent                            |
| `teammate_name`    | Name of the teammate completing the task. May be absent                    |
| `team_name`        | Deprecated. Session-derived team name; will be removed in a future release |

#### TaskCompleted decision control

TaskCompleted hooks support two ways to control task completion:

* **Exit code 2**: the task is not marked as completed and the stderr message is fed back to the model as feedback.
* **JSON `\{"continue": false, "stopReason": "..."\}`**: when a teammate finishing its turn triggered the event, stops the teammate entirely, matching `Stop` hook behavior. The `stopReason` is shown to the user. When the `TaskUpdate` tool triggered the event, Claude Code ignores `continue: false`; exit code 2 still blocks the completion.

This example runs tests and blocks task completion if they fail:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TASK_SUBJECT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.task_subject')

# Run the test suite
if ! npm test 2>&1; then
  echo "Tests not passing. Fix failing tests before completing: $TASK_SUBJECT" >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```
