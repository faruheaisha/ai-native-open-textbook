### Setup

Fires only when you launch Claude Code with `--init-only`, or with `--init` or `--maintenance` in [non-interactive mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag. It doesn't fire on normal startup. Use it for one-time dependency installation or scheduled cleanup that you trigger explicitly from CI or scripts, separate from normal session startup. For per-session initialization, use [SessionStart](#sessionstart) instead.

The matcher value corresponds to the CLI flag that triggered the hook:

| Matcher       | When it fires                              |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| `init`        | `claude --init-only` or `claude -p --init` |
| `maintenance` | `claude -p --maintenance`                  |

When you run `claude --init-only`, Claude Code runs Setup hooks and `SessionStart` hooks with the `startup` matcher, then exits without starting a conversation.

When you start or continue a conversation with `-p`, you also need to supply a prompt, as an argument or piped on stdin. You can skip the prompt when a `SessionStart` hook supplies [`initialUserMessage`](#sessionstart-decision-control) or when you resume a session with a [deferred tool call](#defer-a-tool-call-for-later).

On success, `--init-only` prints nothing to the terminal. To confirm the hooks ran, start with `claude --debug-file <path> --init-only`, replacing `<path>` with a log file location, and check the log for the Setup and SessionStart hook entries.

Because Setup doesn't fire on every launch, a plugin that needs a dependency installed can't rely on Setup alone. The practical pattern is to check for the dependency on first use and install on miss, for example a hook or skill that tests for `$\{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA\}/node_modules` and runs `npm install` if absent. See the [persistent data directory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#persistent-data-directory) for where to store installed dependencies. If you distribute your plugin through a marketplace, you may not need this pattern: Claude Code [installs eligible Node.js package dependencies automatically](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#node-js-package-dependencies) when it caches the plugin.

#### Setup input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), Setup hooks receive a `trigger` field set to either `"init"` or `"maintenance"`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "Setup",
  "trigger": "init"
}
```

#### Setup decision control

Setup hooks can't block; execution continues on any exit code. On every exit code, Claude Code discards a Setup hook's [JSON output fields](#json-output), such as `systemMessage`, `continue`, and `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. With `-p`, a Setup hook's stdout, stderr, and exit code appear in the run's output only as [`hook_response` events](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless#read-session-metadata) when you launch with `--output-format stream-json --verbose`.

Setup hooks have access to `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`. Variables written to that file persist into subsequent Bash commands for the session, just as in [SessionStart hooks](#persist-environment-variables). Only `type: "command"` hooks run on `Setup`. A `type: "mcp_tool"` hook on `Setup` is always skipped, as described under [MCP tool hook fields](#mcp-tool-hook-fields).
