### How agent hooks work

When an agent hook fires:

1. Claude Code spawns a subagent with your prompt and the hook's JSON input
2. The subagent can use tools like Read, Grep, and Glob to investigate
3. After up to 50 turns, the subagent returns a structured `\{ "ok": true/false \}` decision
4. Claude Code allows the action if `ok` is `true`. If `ok` is `false`, Claude Code handles the block the same way as a prompt hook with `continueOnBlock: true` on that event, as listed under [Response schema](#response-schema)

Agent hooks are useful when verification requires inspecting actual files or test output, not just evaluating the hook input data alone.
