## What you can do with MCP

With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to:

* **Implement features from issue trackers**: "Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub."
* **Analyze monitoring data**: "Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521."
* **Query databases**: "Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our PostgreSQL database."
* **Integrate designs**: "Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack"
* **Automate workflows**: "Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature."
* **React to external events**: an MCP server can also act as a [channel](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels) that pushes messages into your session, so Claude reacts to Telegram messages, Discord chats, or webhook events while you're away.
