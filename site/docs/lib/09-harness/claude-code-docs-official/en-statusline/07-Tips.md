## Tips

* **Test with mock input**: `echo '\{"model":\{"display_name":"Opus"\},"workspace":\{"current_dir":"/home/user/project"\},"context_window":\{"used_percentage":25\},"session_id":"test-session-abc"\}' | ./statusline.sh`
* **Keep output short**: the status bar has limited width, so long output may get truncated or wrap awkwardly
* **Cache slow operations**: your script runs frequently during active sessions, so commands like `git status` can cause lag. See the [caching example](#cache-expensive-operations) for how to handle this.

Community projects like [ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) and [starship-claude](https://github.com/martinemde/starship-claude) provide pre-built configurations with themes and additional features.
