## What the timeline shows

The session walks through a realistic flow with representative token counts:

* **Before you type anything**: CLAUDE.md, auto memory, MCP tool names, and skill descriptions all load into context. Your own setup may add more here, like an [output style](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles) or text from [`--append-system-prompt`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference).
* **As Claude works**: each file read adds to context, [path-scoped rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#path-specific-rules) load automatically alongside matching files, and a [PostToolUse hook](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) fires after each edit.
* **The follow-up prompt**: a [subagent](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) handles the research in its own separate context window, so the large file reads stay out of yours. Only the summary and a small metadata trailer come back.
* **At the end**: `/compact` replaces the conversation with a structured summary. Most startup content reloads automatically; the table below shows what happens to each mechanism.
