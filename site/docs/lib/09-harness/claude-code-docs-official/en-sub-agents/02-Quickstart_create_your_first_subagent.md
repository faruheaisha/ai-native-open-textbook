## Quickstart: create your first subagent

Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. To create one, ask Claude to write it for you, or [write the file yourself](#write-subagent-files).

As of v2.1.198, the `/agents` command no longer opens the interactive creation wizard; running it prints a reminder to ask Claude or edit `.claude/agents/` directly. Subagent files, frontmatter fields, and the `.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/agents/` locations are unchanged; only the terminal wizard is removed.

This walkthrough creates a user-level subagent that reviews code and suggests improvements.

    In Claude Code, describe the subagent you want and where to save it:

    ```text wrap theme=\{null\}
    Create a personal code-improver subagent in ~/.claude/agents/ that scans
    files and suggests improvements for readability, performance, and best
    practices. It should explain each issue, show the current code, and
    provide an improved version. Make it read-only and have it use Sonnet.
    ```

    Claude writes the file with a `name`, a `description`, a `tools` list, a `model`, and a system prompt.

    Open `~/.claude/agents/code-improver.md` and confirm the frontmatter matches what you asked for. The result looks like this:

    ```markdown theme=\{null\}
    ---
    name: code-improver
    description: Scans files and suggests improvements for readability, performance, and best practices. Use after writing or modifying code.
    tools: Read, Grep, Glob
    model: sonnet
    ---

    You are a code improvement specialist. For each issue you find, explain
    the problem, show the current code, and provide an improved version.
    ```

    Because the file lives in `~/.claude/agents/`, the subagent is available in every project on your machine. To scope it to one project instead, move it to that project's `.claude/agents/` directory. [Choose the subagent scope](#choose-the-subagent-scope) compares the two.

    Ask Claude to delegate to the new subagent:

    ```text wrap theme=\{null\}
    Use the code-improver agent to suggest improvements in this project
    ```

    Claude delegates to your new subagent, which scans the codebase and returns improvement suggestions. In the transcript, the delegation appears as a tool call row showing the subagent's name followed by a short task description, such as `code-improver(Suggest code improvements)`.

    If Claude can't find the new subagent, restart Claude Code and try again. This happens only when `~/.claude/agents/` didn't exist before the session started, because a running session doesn't detect a newly created `agents` directory.

You now have a subagent you can use in any project on your machine to analyze codebases and suggest improvements.

You can also write subagent files by hand, define them via CLI flags, or distribute them through plugins. The following sections cover all configuration options.

  On Claude Code v2.1.197 and earlier, `/agents` opens an interactive wizard with a **Running** tab that lists live subagents and a **Library** tab for creating, editing, and deleting them.&#x20;
