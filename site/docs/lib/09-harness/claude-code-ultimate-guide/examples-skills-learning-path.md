# Executable Claude Code Learning Path

This dependency-free prototype turns the existing [seven-module learning path](/lib/09-harness/claude-code-ultimate-guide/guide-learning-path) into a local progression. It stores only learner-owned state in `.claude/learning/claude-code-guide-progress.json` under the target project.

## What it does

- creates one of four tracks: Beginner, Practitioner, Production, or Maintainer;
- unlocks modules only after their prerequisites have recorded evidence;
- requires a non-empty evidence note for every completion;
- produces a deterministic next module, current status, and due-review list;
- schedules reviews at 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days;
- writes the JSON state atomically and refuses corrupt state.

It is a local learning aid. It does not prove competence, upload evidence, or replace a human review of an exercise.

## Quick start

Use the public self-assessment workflow first:

```text
/self-assessment quick
```

Then start the lowest track matching your immediate goal:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/progress.py" --root "$PWD" init --track Beginner
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/progress.py" --root "$PWD" next
```

After performing the exercise, record the evidence:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/progress.py" --root "$PWD" complete module-01 \
  --evidence "Installed Claude Code, ran /help, and recorded the version."
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/progress.py" --root "$PWD" status
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/progress.py" --root "$PWD" due
```

The skill works from a third-party project because it addresses its installed script through `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` and writes state under the current directory. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/progress.py" --root "$PWD" init --track Practitioner
```

## Tracks

| Track | Intended result | Required modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beginner | Work safely through a first Claude Code workflow | 01, 02, 03 |
| Practitioner | Build reusable local agent and skill workflows | 01 to 05 |
| Production | Add hooks, verification, and advanced coordination | 01 to 07 |
| Maintainer | Maintain shared practices and operational safeguards | 01 to 07 |

The diagnostic helps select a starting track, but it does not remove prerequisite checks. A learner who selects Production still completes the sequence in order.

### Self-assessment mapping

| Self-assessment result | Select this track |
| --- | --- |
| Beginner | Beginner |
| Intermediate | Practitioner |
| Advanced | Production |

Maintainer is a manual choice, not a self-assessment result. Use it only when the goal includes shared governance, such as maintaining team instructions, controls, or evidence practices.

The canonical machine-readable map is [assets/path.yaml](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/claude-code-ultimate-guide/blob/af05b84fb6e32432dae2114ee2a72c44ef3d29b1/examples/skills/learning-path/assets/path.yaml). It uses JSON syntax, which is valid YAML, so the standard-library-only Python tool can parse it without PyYAML.

## State and recovery

The state file contains only the selected track, module completion dates, and evidence notes. `init` will not overwrite it. Every save writes a complete temporary file in the same directory, flushes it, and atomically replaces the old file.

If `status`, `next`, `complete`, or `due` reports corrupt state, stop. Preserve a copy of `.claude/learning/claude-code-guide-progress.json` for inspection, repair it manually only after identifying the cause, or remove it deliberately and start a new profile. The prototype will not guess how to recover learner evidence.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest -v examples/skills/learning-path/tests/test_progress.py
```

The focused suite covers profile creation, atomic persistence, prerequisite enforcement, evidence gates, next-module selection, review intervals, and corrupt-state failure.

## Skill validation boundary

`path.yaml` is valid JSON and therefore valid YAML. The dependency-free runtime validates this exact JSON subset with the Python standard library. The bundled `quick_validate.py` skill validator requires PyYAML because it imports `yaml` before it parses `SKILL.md` frontmatter. If PyYAML is absent, frontmatter validation is `UNKNOWN`. Do not report it as a passed skill validation. The local unit suite still verifies that the runtime can load the shipped path definition.
