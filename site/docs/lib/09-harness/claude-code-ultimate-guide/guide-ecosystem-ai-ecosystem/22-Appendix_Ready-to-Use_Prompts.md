## Appendix: Ready-to-Use Prompts

### Perplexity: Technical Spec Research

```
Research [TECHNOLOGY/PATTERN] implementation best practices in [FRAMEWORK].

Requirements:
- Production-ready patterns only (no experimental)
- Include security considerations
- Compare top 3 library options with pros/cons
- Include code examples where helpful
- Cite all sources

Output format: Markdown spec I can feed to a coding assistant.
```

### Gemini: UI to Code

```
Convert this UI screenshot to a [FRAMEWORK] component using [STYLING].

Requirements:
- Use semantic HTML
- Include responsive breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Extract color values as CSS variables
- Add accessibility attributes (aria labels, roles)
- Include hover/focus states visible in the design

Output: Complete component code ready to paste.
```

### Kimi: Code to Presentation

```
Create a [N]-slide presentation from this technical content.

Audience: [TECHNICAL/NON-TECHNICAL]
Purpose: [STAKEHOLDER UPDATE/TRAINING/PITCH]

Requirements:
- One key message per slide
- Include code snippets where relevant (syntax highlighted)
- Add speaker notes for each slide
- Business-friendly language for non-tech audiences
- Include a summary/next steps slide

Output: Downloadable PPTX file.
```

### NotebookLM: Codebase Understanding

After uploading documentation:

```
Based on all sources, explain:
1. The overall architecture pattern used
2. How data flows through the system
3. Key integration points with external services
4. Potential areas of technical debt or complexity
5. How authentication/authorization works

Format as a structured summary I can add to my CLAUDE.md file.
```

### Claude Code: Integrate External Output

```
I have [DESCRIBE SOURCE] from [TOOL].

Context: [PASTE CONTENT]

Integrate this into our project:
- Location: [TARGET DIRECTORY/FILE]
- Adapt to our patterns (check CLAUDE.md)
- Add TypeScript types matching our interfaces
- Connect to existing [STATE/API/HOOKS]
- Add tests following our testing patterns

Validate against existing code before implementing.
```
