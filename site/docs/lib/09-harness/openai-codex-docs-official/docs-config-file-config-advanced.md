# Advanced Configuration

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Use these options when you need more control over providers, policies, and integrations. For a quick start, see [Config basics](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-basic).

For background on project guidance, reusable capabilities, custom slash commands, subagent workflows, and integrations, see [Customization](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/customization/overview). For configuration keys, see [Configuration Reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference).

## Profiles

Profiles let you save named configuration layers and switch between them from
the CLI. When you pass `--profile profile-name`, Codex loads
`~/.codex/config.toml`, then overlays `~/.codex/profile-name.config.toml`.
Profile names can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

Create a separate TOML file for each profile. Use top-level config keys in the
profile file; don't nest them under `[profiles.profile-name]`.

```toml
# ~/.codex/deep-review.config.toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
approval_policy = "on-request"
model_catalog_json = "/Users/me/.codex/model-catalogs/deep-review.json"
```

```shell
codex --profile deep-review
codex exec --profile deep-review "review this change"
```

Because the profile file is a layer above your base user config and below
project and CLI config, it only needs the values that differ from your base
config. Profile files can also override `model_catalog_json`; Codex uses the
profile value when both files set it.

In Codex 0.134.0 and later, `--profile` no longer reads `[profiles.profile-name]`
from `config.toml`, and the top-level `profile = "profile-name"` selector is no
longer supported. Move legacy profile settings into
`~/.codex/profile-name.config.toml`, then remove the matching
`[profiles.profile-name]` table and `profile = "profile-name"` selector from
`config.toml`.

## One-off overrides from the CLI

In addition to editing `~/.codex/config.toml`, you can override configuration for a single run from the CLI:

- Prefer dedicated flags when they exist (for example, `--model`).
- Use `-c` / `--config` when you need to override an arbitrary key.

Examples:

```shell
# Dedicated flag
codex --model gpt-5.6-terra

# Generic key/value override (value is TOML, not JSON)
codex --config model='"gpt-5.6-terra"'
codex --config sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true
codex --config 'shell_environment_policy.include_only=["PATH","HOME"]'
```

Notes:

- Keys can use dot notation to set nested values (for example, `mcp_servers.context7.enabled=false`).
- `--config` values are parsed as TOML. When in doubt, quote the value so your shell doesn't split it on spaces.
- If the value can't be parsed as TOML, Codex treats it as a string.

## Config and state locations

Codex stores its local state under `CODEX_HOME` (defaults to `~/.codex`).

Common files you may see there:

- `config.toml` (your local configuration)
- `auth.json` (if you use file-based credential storage) or your OS keychain/keyring
- `history.jsonl` (if history persistence is enabled)
- Other per-user state such as logs and caches

For authentication details (including credential storage modes), see [Authentication](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth). For the full list of configuration keys, see [Configuration Reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference).

For shared defaults, rules, and skills checked into repos or system paths, see [Team Config](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/admin-setup#step-4-standardize-local-configuration-with-team-config).

If you just need to point the built-in OpenAI provider at an LLM proxy, router, or data-residency enabled project, set `openai_base_url` in `config.toml` instead of defining a new provider. This changes the base URL for the built-in `openai` provider without requiring a separate `model_providers.<id>` entry.

```toml
openai_base_url = "https://us.api.openai.com/v1"
```

## Project config files (`.codex/config.toml`)

In addition to your user config, Codex reads project-scoped overrides from `.codex/config.toml` files inside your repo. Codex walks from the project root to your current working directory and loads every `.codex/config.toml` it finds. If multiple files define the same key, the closest file to your working directory wins.

For security, Codex loads project-scoped config files only when the project is trusted. If the project is untrusted, Codex ignores project `.codex/` layers, including `.codex/config.toml`, project-local hooks, and project-local rules. User and system layers remain separate and still load.

Relative paths inside a project config (for example, `model_instructions_file`) are resolved relative to the `.codex/` folder that contains the `config.toml`.

Project config files can't override settings that redirect credentials, alter
host-owned app request metadata, change provider auth, select config profiles,
or run machine-local notification/telemetry commands. Codex ignores the
following keys in project-local `.codex/config.toml` and prints a startup
warning when it sees them: `openai_base_url`, `chatgpt_base_url`,
`apps_mcp_product_sku`, `model_provider`, `model_providers`, `notify`,
`profile`, `profiles`, `experimental_realtime_ws_base_url`, and `otel`. Set
provider, notification, and telemetry keys in your user-level
`~/.codex/config.toml`; select config profiles with `--profile profile-name`
and `~/.codex/profile-name.config.toml`.

## Hooks

Codex can also load lifecycle hooks from either `hooks.json` files or inline
`[hooks]` tables in `config.toml` files that sit next to active config layers.

In practice, the four most useful locations are:

- `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json`
- `<repo>/.codex/config.toml`

Project-local hooks load only when the project `.codex/` layer is trusted.
User-level hooks remain independent of project trust.

Inline TOML hooks use the same event structure as `hooks.json`:

```toml
[[hooks.PreToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PreToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = '/usr/bin/python3 "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/pre_tool_use_policy.py"'
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Checking Bash command"
```

If a single layer contains both `hooks.json` and inline `[hooks]`, Codex loads
both and warns. Prefer one representation per layer.

For the current event list, input fields, output behavior, and limitations, see
[Hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks).

## Agent roles (`[agents]` in `config.toml`)

For subagent role configuration (`[agents]` in `config.toml`), see [Subagents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents).

## Project root detection

Codex discovers project configuration (for example, `.codex/` layers and `AGENTS.md`) by walking up from the working directory until it reaches a project root.

By default, Codex treats a directory containing `.git` as the project root. To customize this behavior, set `project_root_markers` in `config.toml`:

```toml
# Treat a directory as the project root when it contains any of these markers.
project_root_markers = [".git", ".hg", ".sl"]
```

Set `project_root_markers = []` to skip searching parent directories and treat the current working directory as the project root.

## Custom model providers

A model provider defines how Codex connects to a model (base URL, wire API, authentication, and optional HTTP headers). Custom providers can't reuse the reserved built-in provider IDs: `openai`, `ollama`, and `lmstudio`.

Define additional providers and point `model_provider` at them:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.6-terra"
model_provider = "proxy"

[model_providers.proxy]
name = "OpenAI using LLM proxy"
base_url = "http://proxy.example.com"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

[model_providers.local_ollama]
name = "Ollama"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"

[model_providers.mistral]
name = "Mistral"
base_url = "https://api.mistral.ai/v1"
env_key = "MISTRAL_API_KEY"
```

If a custom provider supports the standalone web search endpoint, advertise
that capability in its provider configuration:

```toml
[model_providers.proxy]
name = "OpenAI using LLM proxy"
base_url = "https://proxy.example.com/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
supports_standalone_web_search = true
```

The setting defaults to `false` for custom providers. Standalone web search is
under development and off by default. Setting the provider capability to `true`
doesn't enable it: the provider must support a compatible endpoint,
and the selected model and runtime must support standalone search. The
configured [`web_search` mode](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/web-search) and
managed search restrictions still apply.

Add request headers when needed:

```toml
[model_providers.example]
http_headers = { "X-Example-Header" = "example-value" }
env_http_headers = { "X-Example-Features" = "EXAMPLE_FEATURES" }
```

Use command-backed authentication when a provider needs Codex to fetch bearer tokens from an external credential helper:

```toml
[model_providers.proxy]
name = "OpenAI using LLM proxy"
base_url = "https://proxy.example.com/v1"
wire_api = "responses"

[model_providers.proxy.auth]
command = "/usr/local/bin/fetch-codex-token"
args = ["--audience", "codex"]
timeout_ms = 5000
refresh_interval_ms = 300000
```

The auth command receives no `stdin` and must print the token to stdout. Codex trims surrounding whitespace, treats an empty token as an error, and refreshes proactively at `refresh_interval_ms`; set `refresh_interval_ms = 0` to refresh only after an authentication retry. Don't combine `[model_providers.<id>.auth]` with `env_key`, `experimental_bearer_token`, or `requires_openai_auth`.

### Amazon Bedrock provider

Codex includes a built-in `amazon-bedrock` model provider. Set it directly as
`model_provider`; unlike custom providers, this built-in provider supports only
the nested AWS profile and region overrides.

```toml
model_provider = "amazon-bedrock"
