## Apps (connectors)

Use `app/installed` to read the latest committed installed app runtime snapshot.
Each result includes the app `id`, `runtimeName` (or `null`), effective
`enabled` state, and `callable` state. An app is callable only when effective
configuration enables it and at least one model-visible tool complies with the
app and tool policies.

```json
{
  "method": "app/installed",
  "id": 49,
  "params": {
    "threadId": "thread-1",
    "forceRefresh": false
  }
}
{
  "id": 49,
  "result": {
    "apps": [
      {
        "id": "demo-app",
        "runtimeName": "Demo App",
        "enabled": true,
        "callable": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Omit `threadId` to use the global configuration instead of a loaded thread's
configuration. Set `forceRefresh: true` to refresh the connector runtime
snapshot before reading it. When global or workspace policy blocks app access,
an observed app can still appear with `enabled` and `callable` set to `false`.

Use `app/list` to fetch available apps. In the CLI/TUI, `/apps` is the user-facing picker; in custom clients, call `app/list` directly. Each entry includes both `isAccessible` (available to the user) and `isEnabled` (enabled in `config.toml`) so clients can distinguish install/access from local enabled state. App entries can also include optional `branding`, `appMetadata`, and `labels` fields.

```json
{ "method": "app/list", "id": 50, "params": {
  "cursor": null,
  "limit": 50,
  "threadId": "thread-1",
  "forceRefetch": false
} }
{ "id": 50, "result": {
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "demo-app",
      "name": "Demo App",
      "description": "Example connector for documentation.",
      "logoUrl": "https://example.com/demo-app.png",
      "logoUrlDark": null,
      "distributionChannel": null,
      "branding": null,
      "appMetadata": null,
      "labels": null,
      "installUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/apps/demo-app/demo-app",
      "isAccessible": true,
      "isEnabled": true
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": null
} }
```

If you provide `threadId`, app feature gating (`features.apps`) uses that thread's config snapshot. When omitted, app-server uses the latest global config.

`app/list` returns after both accessible apps and directory apps load. Set `forceRefetch: true` to bypass app caches and fetch fresh data. Cache entries are only replaced when refreshes succeed.

The server also emits `app/list/updated` notifications whenever either source (accessible apps or directory apps) finishes loading. Each notification includes the latest merged app list.

```json
{
  "method": "app/list/updated",
  "params": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "demo-app",
        "name": "Demo App",
        "description": "Example connector for documentation.",
        "logoUrl": "https://example.com/demo-app.png",
        "logoUrlDark": null,
        "distributionChannel": null,
        "branding": null,
        "appMetadata": null,
        "labels": null,
        "installUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/apps/demo-app/demo-app",
        "isAccessible": true,
        "isEnabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Use `app/read` when you already know the app ids and need app metadata rather
than installed runtime state. Pass at most 100 `appIds`. The server keeps only
the first occurrence of each repeated id and preserves that order in both
`apps` and `missingAppIds`. Unknown or inaccessible apps are returned in
`missingAppIds` without failing the entire request.

```json
{
  "method": "app/read",
  "id": 52,
  "params": {
    "appIds": ["demo-app", "missing-app"],
    "includeTools": true
  }
}
{
  "id": 52,
  "result": {
    "apps": [
      {
        "id": "demo-app",
        "name": "Demo App",
        "description": "Example connector for documentation.",
        "iconUrl": null,
        "iconUrlDark": null,
        "distributionChannel": null,
        "installUrl": null,
        "pluginDisplayNames": [],
        "toolSummaries": [
          {
            "name": "search",
            "title": "Search",
            "description": "Search the app.",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "disabledReason": null,
            "isReadOnly": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "missingAppIds": ["missing-app"]
  }
}
```

Set `includeTools: true` to request display-only public tool summaries. The
metadata response doesn't include installed app runtime state or authorize a
tool call; use `app/installed` to check effective `enabled` and `callable`
state.
