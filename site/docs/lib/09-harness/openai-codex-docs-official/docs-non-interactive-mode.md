# Non-interactive mode

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Non-interactive mode lets you run Codex from scripts (for example, continuous integration (CI) jobs) without opening the interactive TUI.
You invoke it with `codex exec`.

For flag-level details, see [`codex exec`](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/developer-commands?surface=cli#cli-codex-exec).

## When to use `codex exec`

Use `codex exec` when you want Codex to:

- Run as part of a pipeline (CI, pre-merge checks, scheduled jobs).
- Produce output you can pipe into other tools (for example, to generate release notes or summaries).
- Fit naturally into CLI workflows that chain command output into Codex and pass Codex output to other tools.
- Run with explicit, pre-set sandbox and approval settings.

## Basic usage

Pass a task prompt as a single argument:

```bash
codex exec "summarize the repository structure and list the top 5 risky areas"
```

While `codex exec` runs, Codex streams progress to `stderr` and prints only the final agent message to `stdout`. This makes it straightforward to redirect or pipe the final result:

```bash
codex exec "generate release notes for the last 10 commits" | tee release-notes.md
```

Use `--ephemeral` when you don't want to persist session rollout files to disk:

```bash
codex exec --ephemeral "triage this repository and suggest next steps"
```

If stdin is piped and you also provide a prompt argument, Codex treats the prompt as the instruction and the piped content as additional context.

This lets you generate input with one command and hand it directly to Codex:

```bash
curl -s https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments \
  | codex exec "format the top 20 items into a markdown table" \
  > table.md
```

For more advanced stdin piping patterns, see [Advanced stdin piping](#advanced-stdin-piping).

## Permissions and safety

By default, `codex exec` runs in a read-only sandbox. In automation, set the least permissions needed for the workflow:

- Allow edits: `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write "<task>"`
- Allow broader access: `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access "<task>"`

Use `danger-full-access` only in a controlled environment (for example, an isolated CI runner or container).

Codex keeps `codex exec --full-auto` as a deprecated compatibility flag and prints a warning. Prefer the explicit `--sandbox workspace-write` flag in new scripts.

Use `--ignore-user-config` when you need a run that doesn't load `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, and `--ignore-rules` when you need to skip user and project execpolicy `.rules` files for a controlled automation environment.

If you configure an enabled MCP server with `required = true` and it fails to initialize, `codex exec` exits with an error instead of continuing without that server.

## Make output machine-readable

To consume Codex output in scripts, use JSON Lines output:

```bash
codex exec --json "summarize the repo structure" | jq
```

When you enable `--json`, `stdout` becomes a JSON Lines (JSONL) stream so you can capture every event Codex emits while it's running. Event types include `thread.started`, `turn.started`, `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, `item.*`, and `error`.

Item types include agent messages, reasoning, command executions, file changes, MCP tool calls, web searches, and plan updates.

Sample JSON stream (each line is a JSON object):

```jsonl
{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"0199a213-81c0-7800-8aa1-bbab2a035a53"}
{"type":"turn.started"}
{"type":"item.started","item":{"id":"item_1","type":"command_execution","command":"bash -lc ls","status":"in_progress"}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_3","type":"agent_message","text":"Repo contains docs, sdk, and examples directories."}}
{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{"input_tokens":24763,"cached_input_tokens":24448,"output_tokens":122,"reasoning_output_tokens":0}}
```

If you only need the final message, write it to a file with `-o <path>`/`--output-last-message <path>`. This writes the final message to the file and still prints it to `stdout` (see [`codex exec`](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/developer-commands?surface=cli#cli-codex-exec) for details).

## Create structured outputs with a schema

If you need structured data for downstream steps, use `--output-schema` to request a final response that conforms to a JSON Schema.
This is useful for automated workflows that need stable fields (for example, job summaries, risk reports, or release metadata).

`schema.json`

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "project_name": { "type": "string" },
    "programming_languages": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "required": ["project_name", "programming_languages"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Run Codex with the schema and write the final JSON response to disk:

```bash
codex exec "Extract project metadata" \
  --output-schema ./schema.json \
  -o ./project-metadata.json
```

Example final output (stdout):

```json
{
  "project_name": "Codex CLI",
  "programming_languages": ["Rust", "TypeScript", "Shell"]
}
```

## Authenticate in automation

`codex exec` reuses saved CLI authentication by default. In CI, it's common to provide credentials explicitly:

If your trusted cloud or CI runtime already receives short-lived workload
tokens, use
[workload identity federation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/workload-identity)
instead of storing an OpenAI credential.

### Use API key auth

For GitHub Actions, use the [Codex GitHub Action](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/github-action) instead of installing and authenticating the CLI yourself. The action is designed to reduce API key exposure by installing Codex, starting a Responses API proxy, and running Codex with a configurable safety strategy.

Do not set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` as a job-level environment variable in workflows that check out or run repository-controlled code. Build scripts, tests, dependency lifecycle hooks, or a compromised action in the same job can read those environment variables.

For other automation environments, set `CODEX_API_KEY` only for the Codex
invocation that needs it, and make sure no untrusted code runs in the same
process environment.

To use a different API key for a single run, set `CODEX_API_KEY` inline:

```bash
