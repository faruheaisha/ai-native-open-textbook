# Work with files

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

When a task produces a file, give ChatGPT the source data, expected file type,
structure, and review criteria that matter for the task. The preview and review
tools depend on the surface you use.

[Watch: Work with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dDr_QtBuo)

The ChatGPT desktop app previews generated documents, presentations,
spreadsheets, and PDF files alongside the chat. When automatic previews are
enabled, the app can open a generated file after a task finishes.

When HTML previews are available, generated `.html` and `.htm` files can also
open as interactive previews. Switch between the rendered preview and source
view to inspect the output or its underlying HTML.

Use annotations to point at a specific part of a supported preview and request
a focused revision.

In ChatGPT Work on the web, attach source files or ask ChatGPT to create a
document, presentation, spreadsheet, or PDF. Review the generated file in the
chat, download it when needed, and give targeted feedback for the next version.

Codex CLI can create and edit files in the working directory, but it doesn't
include a visual file preview or annotation interface. Ask Codex to report each
output path and the checks it ran.

The IDE extension can create and edit files in the workspace. Review text and
code files in the editor, and open documents, presentations, spreadsheets, or
PDF files in a compatible viewer.

## Create files for review

For spreadsheets and presentations, describe the sheets, columns, charts,
slide sections, and checks you expect. Ask ChatGPT to explain where it saved the
output and how it checked the result.

## Refine files with annotations

Annotations let you point to a specific part of a file and tell ChatGPT
what to change. The same annotation workflow available for code, Markdown
files, and websites also works with documents, spreadsheets, and
presentations.

For example, you can:

- Select a navigation bar on a website and ask ChatGPT to change its font.
- Highlight a claim in an investment thesis and ask for its source.
- Mark a chart on a slide and request a clearer label.

ChatGPT uses the selected area as context for your request, so you can refine
the file without starting over or changing the parts you already like.
Annotations are particularly useful after the first draft, when the work needs
review and iteration.

## Review and refine files on the web

Open or download the generated file to review it in the appropriate viewer.
When you request a revision, name the page, slide, sheet, table, or passage that
needs attention and describe what should stay unchanged. Ask ChatGPT to report
the new file name and the checks it performed before you download the next
version.

## Review and refine files

Use the chat sidebar while a task runs. It can surface the agent's plan,
sources, generated files, and chat summary so you can steer the work,
inspect generated files, and request another pass.

Ask ChatGPT to explain where it saved each file and how it verified the
result. Use the preview to inspect the output, then give focused feedback about
the structure, data, layout, or validation that needs another pass.
