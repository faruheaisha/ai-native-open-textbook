## Manual Release

For hotfixes or exceptional cases, you can trigger a release manually. Use the `hotfix` commit type so as to not trigger a further PR update/version bump.

1. Go to **Actions** > `🚀 Package Release`
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select the package to release
4. **Provide `version`**: the version you want to publish (e.g. `0.0.35`). The workflow checks that the code you selected has the same version.
