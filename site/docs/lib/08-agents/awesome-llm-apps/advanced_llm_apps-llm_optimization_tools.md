# 🎯 LLM Optimization Tools

A collection of tools and techniques to optimize your LLM applications - reduce costs, improve performance, and maximize efficiency.

---

## 📚 Tools Available

### 🎯 [Toonify Token Optimization](/lib/08-agents/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps-llm_optimization_tools-toonify_token_optimization)

**Reduce LLM API costs by 30-60%** using TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format.

#### What it does:
- Converts JSON data to compact TOON format
- Reduces token usage significantly
- Maintains data structure and readability
- Saves money on API calls

#### Key Features:
- ✅ **63.9% average token reduction** vs JSON
- ✅ **Up to 73.4% savings** for tabular data
- ✅ Human-readable format
- ✅ Roundtrip conversion (JSON ↔ TOON)
- ✅ Schema validation support
- ✅ Interactive Streamlit app

#### Quick Example:
```python
from toon import encode, decode

# Your data (247 bytes as JSON)
data = {
  "products": [
    {"id": 101, "name": "Laptop Pro", "price": 1299},
    {"id": 102, "name": "Magic Mouse", "price": 79}
  ]
}

# Convert to TOON (98 bytes - 60% reduction!)
toon_str = encode(data)
# products[2]{id,name,price}:
#   101,Laptop Pro,1299
#   102,Magic Mouse,79

# Pass to LLM with reduced cost
response = llm.complete(f"Analyze: {toon_str}")
```

#### Use Cases:
- 📊 Pass large datasets to LLMs
- 💰 Reduce API costs significantly
- 🔄 Optimize context window usage
- 📈 Improve response times

#### Get Started:
```bash
cd toonify_token_optimization/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python quick_test.py
```

## 💡 Why Optimize?

### Cost Savings
LLM API costs are based on token count. Reducing tokens = saving money!

**Example Savings (GPT-4)**:
- 1,000 API calls: **$2.15 saved**
- 100,000 API calls: **$214.70 saved**
- 1M API calls: **$2,147.00 saved** 💰

### Performance
Fewer tokens = faster processing and better efficiency.

### Context Window
Maximize what you can fit in your context window by using compact formats.

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Compact Formats for Structured Data
When passing data to LLMs, use efficient serialization:
- ✅ TOON for tabular/structured data
- ✅ CSV for simple datasets
- ❌ Avoid verbose JSON with excessive whitespace

### 2. Optimize Prompts
- Be concise and clear
- Remove unnecessary examples
- Use structured formats

### 3. Batch Processing
- Group similar requests
- Reuse context when possible
- Cache frequent responses

### 4. Choose the Right Model
- Use smaller models for simple tasks
- Reserve GPT-4 for complex reasoning
- Consider fine-tuned models

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Format | Size | Tokens | Cost (per 1M calls) | Best For |
|--------|------|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **JSON (verbose)** | 247 B | 85 | $2,550 | Compatibility |
| **JSON (compact)** | 189 B | 67 | $2,010 | Standard use |
| **TOON** | 98 B | 39 | $1,170 | Structured data |
| **CSV** | 112 B | 42 | $1,260 | Simple tables |

*Based on GPT-4 pricing ($0.03/1K input tokens)*

## 🚀 Future Tools (Coming Soon)

### Planned Additions:

#### 📦 Prompt Compression
Automatically compress long prompts while preserving meaning.

#### 🗜️ Context Optimization
Smart context window management for long conversations.

#### 📈 Token Analytics
Track and analyze token usage across your applications.

#### 💾 Response Caching
Intelligent caching to avoid redundant API calls.
