# Agent Systems Handbook（智能体系统手册）

import SupportCTA from "/snippets/support-cta.mdx";

## Summary

April 2026 made the interoperability layer easier to separate into distinct
jobs. A2A entered its second year with a production-ready v1.0 and Linux
Foundation governance. A2UI v0.9 positioned itself as the UI-intent layer for
portable generative interfaces. MCP, meanwhile, kept moving deeper into
transport, governance, and enterprise concerns rather than collapsing into a
single protocol for everything.

## Why It Matters

The agent market still talks about interoperability as if one standard will own
tool use, agent coordination, and generated UI. The current signal points in a
better direction. MCP is maturing as a tool and transport substrate. A2A is
hardening the external agent-to-agent boundary. A2UI is trying to standardize
how agents express interface intent against an existing frontend. That
separation is more useful than protocol brand wars.

## Evidence And Sources

- [Protocols And Interoperability](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/5b71cfa598701a34834f33b42be5f8a422138a3c/systems/protocols-and-interoperability/README.md):
  the repo-native comparison page for keeping MCP and A2A boundaries distinct.
- [A year of open collaboration: Celebrating the anniversary of A2A](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2026/04/a-year-of-open-collaboration-celebrating-the-anniversary-of-a2a.html):
  Google frames A2A's first year around Linux Foundation governance, the March
  2026 v1.0 release, and broader ecosystem support.
- [A2UI v0.9: The New Standard for Portable, Framework-Agnostic Generative UI](https://developers.googleblog.com/a2ui-v0-9-generative-ui/):
  Google positions A2UI as a framework-agnostic way for local or remote agents
  to declare UI intent against existing component catalogs.
- [The 2026 MCP Roadmap](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-mcp-roadmap/):
  MCP maintainers frame the year around transport scalability, agent
  communication, governance maturation, and enterprise readiness.

## Signals To Watch

- Whether A2A keeps its complementary boundary with MCP clear as more vendors
  bring agent-to-agent exchange into production.
- Whether A2UI gains adoption beyond early Google-adjacent experiments,
  especially through React and community renderers.
- Whether MCP's agent-communication work ends up narrowing the distinction
  between tool access and inter-agent exchange or making it cleaner.

## Update Log

- 2026-04-23: Added an April 2026 interoperability note using current official
  A2A, A2UI, and MCP updates.
