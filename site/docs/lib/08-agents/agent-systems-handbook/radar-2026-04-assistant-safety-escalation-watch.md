# Agent Systems Handbook（智能体系统手册）

import SupportCTA from "/snippets/support-cta.mdx";

## Summary

The April 2026 lawsuits around the Tumbler Ridge school shooting make one
agent-systems question unusually concrete: when an assistant provider detects
credible real-world violence signals, the product problem is no longer just
content moderation. It becomes escalation design.

For handbook readers, the practical takeaway is to separate normal privacy
expectations from the narrow cases where a risk review may need to preserve
evidence, override routine retention assumptions, and involve a named human
owner.

## Why It Matters

Assistant safety can be described too vaguely as "the model should refuse bad
requests." That is not enough for deployed systems. High-risk interactions
create operational questions that need explicit answers:

- what gets logged when the system detects violent intent
- who owns the review after an automated or human flag
- which threshold triggers internal escalation
- which threshold triggers external reporting or legal review
- how repeat policy violators are recognized without turning every user record
  into an unbounded surveillance surface
- how later reviewers can reconstruct what the assistant did, what the user
  said, and what the operator decided

Those questions sit between privacy, trust and safety, legal, incident
response, and product operations. They should not be left as an implicit model
behavior.

## Evidence And Sources

- [Families of Canada school shooting victims sue OpenAI over shooter's use of ChatGPT](https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-tumbler-ridge-26d632a065e8420a263655c8ee29f961):
  AP reported that families filed U.S. lawsuits alleging OpenAI should have
  alerted authorities after earlier account activity was flagged. OpenAI said
  it had strengthened safeguards around distress responses, threat escalation,
  and repeat policy violators.
- [School-shooting lawsuits accuse OpenAI of hiding violent ChatGPT users](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/04/school-shooting-lawsuits-accuse-openai-of-hiding-violent-chatgpt-users/):
  Ars Technica framed the allegation around internal review, external warning
  thresholds, and whether safety flags were acted on before a later attack.

## Signals To Watch

- Whether assistant providers publish clearer thresholds for violent-threat
  escalation without exposing detection playbooks that bad actors can evade.
- Whether products create auditable internal handoff records instead of leaving
  escalations buried in chat logs or ad hoc moderation queues.
- Whether repeat-offender detection becomes a distinct trust boundary from
  ordinary personalization, memory, and account analytics.
- Whether enterprise assistant deployments require customers to name legal,
  security, and trust-and-safety owners before risky workflows go live.
- Whether regulators and courts treat failure-to-warn claims as product design
  failures, operational negligence, or something closer to platform-liability
  doctrine.

## Design Implications

Builders should treat safety escalation as a workflow surface:

- keep the model refusal path separate from the human escalation path
- write down who can view retained high-risk evidence
- preserve just enough context for later audit
- require human review before external reporting unless law or policy requires
  immediate action
- make duty-to-report language specific to jurisdiction, organization policy,
  and deployment setting

The important design move is not to make every assistant conversation more
visible. It is to define the rare conditions under which a credible risk signal
becomes an accountable operational case.

## Editorial Take

This belongs in `radar/` because the legal and policy details will continue to
move. The durable handbook lesson is narrower: assistant systems need an
escalation contract, not only a refusal policy.

That contract should say what is detected, what is preserved, who reviews it,
what threshold changes the privacy expectation, and how the decision is later
audited. Without that shape, "safety" remains a model-level aspiration instead
of a system-level workflow.

  boundaries, and audit-ready safety handoffs.
