# Local Document Organizer

## Why This Skill Exists

This package is a Practitioner-facing example of a safety-sensitive local
filesystem workflow.

"Organize my Downloads" sounds trivial, but as soon as the agent starts
moving files, it becomes one of the easier ways to lose work: a wrong
classification, a silent overwrite, or a missing undo path can turn a
helpful action into a recovery problem. The package shows how a Codex skill
can do the useful thing while keeping the user in control.

The pattern is intentionally cautious:

- preview before any move
- explicit confirmation token, not inferred consent
- never delete, never overwrite
- low-confidence files default to staying put
- every applied move is logged with enough information to reverse it

## Who It Is For

This skill is for students, contributors, and operators who want to see what
a real Codex-compatible local workflow looks like when filesystem safety
matters and the user expects to be able to undo an action they did not love.

It is most useful for requests such as:

- propose a folder structure for a messy Downloads folder
- sort invoices, receipts, tax forms, and school documents into named
  subfolders
- preview what would happen before any file is touched
- reverse a previous organization run

## A Simple Mental Model

Think of the workflow as three separate steps:

1. **Scan means looking and proposing.** The user names a folder. The skill
   checks its files and writes a readable preview plus a JSON plan. Nothing
   moves during a scan.
2. **Apply means carrying out only the reviewed plan.** After explicit
   approval with `--confirm ORGANIZE`, the skill creates category folders,
   performs the eligible moves, and records what happened. Conflicts and
   permission errors stay visible instead of being hidden.
3. **Undo means reversing recorded moves.** The skill reads the action log
   and restores only files that were successfully moved. It still refuses
   to overwrite anything.

The agent surfaces the report, the plan, the action log path, and the
results. The user owns the decision to apply and the decision to undo.

## Beginner Terminology

| Term | Plain-language meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Preview | A readable description of the moves the skill proposes. A preview does not move files. |
| Plan | The saved JSON record of proposed source and destination paths that `apply` can review and use. |
| Confidence | The strength assigned by the matching rule. Low confidence normally means the file stays where it is. |
| Approval | The user's explicit permission to apply a reviewed plan, given with the required `ORGANIZE` confirmation token. |
| SHA-256 / hash | A fingerprint of a file's contents. The skill uses it to notice when a file has changed since the plan was created. |
| Journal / action log | A durable record of attempted moves and their results. It provides the evidence needed for recovery. |
| Conflict | A move that cannot safely happen, often because a file with the same name already exists at the destination. The existing file is not overwritten. |
| Undo | A recovery operation that uses the action log to reverse moves that actually succeeded. |

## What The Package Actually Does

This skill organizes files with readable filename keywords and file
extensions. It does not understand, interpret, or summarize the knowledge
inside a document. That is a different kind of task.

- Reads classification rules from a small CSV (extension and filename
  keyword matches with confidence scores).
- Walks the user-named folder, classifies each file in CSV order with
  first-match-wins semantics, and produces a deterministic plan.
- Writes a Markdown preview that groups proposed moves by category and
  surfaces skipped or low-confidence files.
- Executes only the moves the user has approved with the `ORGANIZE` confirm
  token.
- Persists run state in
  `~/.codex/state/local-document-organizer/organizer.sqlite` so past runs
  remain inspectable across sessions.
- Provides an undo command that reverses recorded moves without overwriting.

## What It Does Not Do

This package does not:

- delete files (no `unlink`, no `rmtree`)
- overwrite files (destination collisions are skipped)
- act on `/`, `/System`, `/Library`, `~/Library`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`,
  `~/.aws`, or the home directory itself
- move low-confidence or unmatched files unless the user explicitly opts in
  with `--include-low-confidence`
- send any data to external services

## How To Read It In The Handbook

Treat this package as a Practitioner example of a destructive-looking
workflow that stays reversible:

- `README.md` explains the human story and the three-phase boundary
- `SKILL.md` is the invocation contract for Codex
- `scripts/local_document_organizer.py` implements the deterministic helper
- `references/classification-rules.csv` holds the readable category rules
- `references/safety-rules.md` documents the hard prohibitions and skip
  semantics

If you are a student reading the repo, the main lessons are:

1. preview-first is not a courtesy, it is a safety property
2. an explicit confirmation token (`ORGANIZE`) is harder to grant by
   accident than a free-form "yes"
3. an action log is the difference between a regret and a recovery

## Three Progressive Learning Examples

Each example uses independent synthetic course files. Run its generation
command once from the repository root. The command refuses to replace an
existing output folder.

### Student files

Preview how an invoice, school reading, and internship resume are classified
while an unknown file stays in place.

```bash
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/seed_demo.py --scenario organizer-student-files
```

### Freelancer rules

Observe that meeting notes initially go to `Notes`. Add a readable
`Meetings` filename rule, make a fresh preview, and compare the proposed
destinations before applying anything.

```bash
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/seed_demo.py --scenario organizer-freelancer-rules
```

### Safe recovery

Approve the eligible moves and observe that an existing same-name invoice
is protected from overwrite. Inspect the partial result, then undo the moves
that succeeded.

```bash
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/seed_demo.py --scenario organizer-safe-recovery
```

The [Lesson 2 teaching guide](/lib/08-agents/agent-systems-handbook/skills-course-support-lessons-lesson-2) contains
the detailed command-by-command exercises. This README keeps the mental
model and safety boundaries close at hand.

## Professional AI Agent Course: Organize

### What you will learn

Classify and safely relocate local files, with preview, approval and undo. Do not synthesize their knowledge.

### Prerequisites

Use Python 3.10+, a fork/clone opened in Codex, and the [shared course setup](/lib/08-agents/agent-systems-handbook/skills-course-support-README). Run from the repository root. Seed the synthetic Lesson 2 files once; choose a fresh output directory if they already exist. PDF extraction optionally requires `pypdf`; TXT/Markdown/DOCX need no extra package.

### 5-minute quick start

```bash
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/seed_demo.py
python3 skills/local-document-organizer/scripts/course_organizer.py scan --folder .local-state/course-demo/lesson-2/incoming
```

Sample prompt:

```text
Use $local-document-organizer to preview the synthetic incoming folder, explain every move, and wait for my approval.
```

### Expected result

The preview proposes an invoice and a school document; the unknown extension stays in place. The output contains a plan path, SHA-256 fingerprint and a canonical run id. No source file has moved. These are examples, not recorded production results.

### 20–30 minute classroom exercise

Follow the [Lesson 2 teaching guide](/lib/08-agents/agent-systems-handbook/skills-course-support-lessons-lesson-2)
for the full exercise. It covers reviewing the plan and report, approving
moves, inspecting the action journal, undoing a run, and comparing hashes
to prove restoration. Command shorthand such as `course_organizer.py`
resolves to this package's `scripts/` directory.

### What to modify

Edit `references/classification-rules.csv` to classify one extra synthetic extension; scan again. Compare proposed categories before applying. Never edit a generated approved plan. Edit the canonical package, rerun course setup, and commit only source changes to your fork.

### How to verify persistence

All course commands accept the shared storage flags before the subcommand. Start locally, then use `--storage prompthon` only after the Web App owner provisions the contract and scoped course access.

```bash
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/course_store.py runs --skill local-document-organizer
