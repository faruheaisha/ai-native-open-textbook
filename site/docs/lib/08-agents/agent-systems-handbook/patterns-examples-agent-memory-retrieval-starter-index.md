## Summary

This starter shows one clean way to separate active notes, working memory,
imported personal context, retrieval inputs, citation-bearing verifiable RAG,
and durable artifacts in a small agent loop.

## Status

`starter`

Source code: [patterns/examples/agent-memory-retrieval-starter](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/tree/main/patterns/examples/agent-memory-retrieval-starter)

## Why It Exists

Memory examples often collapse everything into one vague history object. This
starter is intentionally narrower: it highlights the boundary between what the
agent is currently holding, what a user imported from another assistant, what
it can retrieve, what must remain an external file-search corpus, and what it
should preserve as an artifact.

The May 2026 multimodal file-search updates from Google made that retrieval
boundary easier to teach. A useful starter should show metadata filters,
page-level citations, and multimodal chunks without pretending that retrieval
stores are the same thing as agent memory.

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_example_projects.py
```

This is still a starter, not a full application. Read `src/memory_flow.py` for
the state boundary and `src/verifiable_rag.py` for the retrieval-side citation
surface.

## Included Sample Files

- `src/memory_flow.py`: the smallest useful state container for active notes,
  task-scoped working memory, imported personal context, retrieval inputs, and
  durable artifacts
- `src/personal_context.py`: a tiny normalization surface that keeps imported
  preference facts separate from retrieval results and artifacts
- `src/retrieval_trace.py`: a tiny ranking and trace surface for making
  retrieval decisions inspectable
- `src/verifiable_rag.py`: a tiny filter-and-citation surface for metadata
  filters, page numbers, and multimodal grounding output
- `src/artifact_policy.py`: one place to show how a starter can separate
  artifact-promotion rules from raw note capture

## Constraints

- No storage backend is wired yet.
- No embedding or vector-store integration is included.
- No provider SDK is called directly.
- Imported personal context stays deliberately small and reviewable.
- The example favors clear boundaries over completeness.
- Citations are modeled as output artifacts, not as proof that retrieval is
  always correct.

## Flow Boundaries

The starter may:

- keep working memory and personal context separate from retrieval inputs
- apply metadata filters before selecting chunks
- surface page-level and media citations as part of the returned artifact
- keep retrieval traces inspectable enough for review

The starter must not:

- treat a file-search store as durable agent memory
- silently promote retrieved snippets into long-term memory
- hide filter decisions or cited locations from the reviewer

## Next Steps

- Add a simple persistence layer for imported context and durable artifacts.
- Add a clearer review workflow for memory imports before they become active.
- Add a provider adapter for one real file-search API without collapsing the
  retrieval store into the memory layer.
