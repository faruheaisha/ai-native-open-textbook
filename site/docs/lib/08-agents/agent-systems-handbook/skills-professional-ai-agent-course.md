**Specialization ID:** `GW02` · General · Workshop-type

The Professional AI Agent Course is a six-class short course. This page documents twelve capabilities from Lessons 2–5, with three capabilities per lesson. Every skill below links directly to its complete codebase, including its human-facing guide, Codex instructions, metadata, scripts, references and classroom fixtures.

For the separate three-phase pathway combining private coaching, open-source contribution, and supervised project work, see the [PT01 · AI-Native Internship specialization](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/5b71cfa598701a34834f33b42be5f8a422138a3c/specializations/ai-native-internship/README.md).

Use the [course package guide](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/develop/skills/course-support/README.md) for installation, synthetic fixtures, English and Simplified Chinese exercises, modification tasks and reset instructions. The lesson guides are also available directly: [Lesson 2](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/develop/skills/course-support/lessons/lesson-2.md), [Lesson 3](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/develop/skills/course-support/lessons/lesson-3.md), [Lesson 4](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/develop/skills/course-support/lessons/lesson-4.md) and [Lesson 5](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/develop/skills/course-support/lessons/lesson-5.md). Existing organizer, knowledge-capture and Social packages are extended rather than duplicated.

```bash
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/setup_course_skills.py --lesson 2
python3 skills/course-support/scripts/seed_demo.py
```

The public/offline mode stores course records locally. The intended instructor-provisioned course mode uses a scoped Prompthon API and server-side Neon/PostgreSQL. The [backend dependency](https://github.com/Prompthon-IO/agent-systems-handbook/blob/develop/skills/course-support/references/backend-dependency.md) must be completed and verified by the Web App owner before remote classroom use. This page does not claim that a production course service has been deployed.

Keep one job per skill, preview consequential actions, preserve original files, and verify persisted state by reading it back. Never distribute production DB credentials or allow students to publish to real Social channels from a classroom fixture.
