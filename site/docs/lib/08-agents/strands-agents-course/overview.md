| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **API Key Issues** | Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly (should start with `sk-ant-`) |
| **Import Errors** | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in course-2 directory |
| **AWS Credentials** | Only needed for Lab 4 MCP integration - configure AWS CLI or environment |
| **MCP Servers** | Allow time for MCP servers to initialize before agent connections in Lab 4 |
| **Memory Backends** | Mem0 API key only required for Lab 6 memory persistence |

### Course 3 Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **AWS Permissions** | Ensure BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess policy is attached to your user/role |
| **Model Access** | Enable Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Amazon Bedrock console |

### Course 4 Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **AWS Permissions** | Ensure BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess policy is attached to your user/role |
| **Model Access** | Enable Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku in Amazon Bedrock console |
| **AgentCore CLI** | Run `pip install bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` if `agentcore` command not found |
