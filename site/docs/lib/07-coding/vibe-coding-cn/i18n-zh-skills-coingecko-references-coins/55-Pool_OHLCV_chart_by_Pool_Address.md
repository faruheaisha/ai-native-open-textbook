## Pool OHLCV chart by Pool Address

**URL:** llms-txt#pool-ohlcv-chart-by-pool-address

Source: https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/pool-ohlcv-contract-address

v3.0.1/reference/api-reference/onchain-demo.json get /networks/\{network\}/pools/\{pool_address\}/ohlcv/\{timeframe\}
This endpoint allows you to **get the OHLCV chart (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) of a pool based on the provided pool address on a network**

* You may use this endpoint to query the historical price and volume of a token.
  * You may select the timeframe with its respective aggregate to get the intended OHLCV data (e.g. `minute?aggregate=15` for 15 minutes OHLCV).

* This endpoint uses epoch/unix format for its timestamp. Example: `1708850449`.
  * [Paid plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan & above) can access data from **September 2021 to the present**, depending on when the pool started tracking on GeckoTerminal.
    * If no earlier data is available, an empty response will be returned.
    * Each API call can only retrieve data for a **maximum range of 6 months**. To fetch older data, use the `before_timestamp` parameter to query in multiple requests.
  * Pools with more than 2 tokens are not yet supported for this endpoint.
  * Each OHLCV array (under "ohlcv\_list") consists of 6 elements in the following order:
    * Timestamp: The epoch/unix timestamp representing the start of the time interval.
    * Open: The opening price of the asset at the beginning of the interval.
    * High: The highest price reached during the interval.
    * Low: The lowest price reached during the interval.
    * Close: The price of the asset at the end of the interval.
    * Volume: The total trading volume of the asset during the interval.
  * **Skipped Intervals**: To ensure concise and relevant data, specific timeframe intervals (e.g. minutely) with no recorded swaps are **excluded** from the response.
    * Higher granularity timeframes (e.g. 1 minute) are more likely to skip intervals due to periods of inactivity, while lower granularity timeframes (e.g. daily) are less affected.
  * For `include_empty_intervals` param:
    * When `false` (default): Only intervals with trade data are returned.
    * When `true`: All requested intervals are returned, those with no trade data are populated as follows:
      * OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) are all set to the Close price of the previous interval.
        * *O = H = L = C = previous Close*
      * Volume (V) is set to 0, reflecting no trade activity.
  * Cache/Update frequency: every 60 seconds.
