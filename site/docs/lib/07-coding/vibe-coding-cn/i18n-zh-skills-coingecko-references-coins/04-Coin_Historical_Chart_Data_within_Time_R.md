## Coin Historical Chart Data within Time Range by Token Address

**URL:** llms-txt#coin-historical-chart-data-within-time-range-by-token-address

Source: https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/contract-address-market-chart-range

v3.0.1/reference/api-reference/coingecko-demo.json get /coins/\{id\}/contract/\{contract_address\}/market_chart/range
This endpoint allows you to **get the historical chart data within certain time range in UNIX along with price, market cap and 24hr volume based on asset platform and particular token contract address**

* You may obtain the asset platform and contract address via several ways:
    * refers to respective coin page and find 'contract address'.
    * refers to [`/coins/list`](https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list) endpoint (`include platform = true`).

* You may leave the interval params as empty for automatic granularity:
    * 1 day from current time = **5-minutely** data
    * 1 day from any time (except current time) = **hourly** data
    * 2 - 90 days from any time = **hourly** data
    * above 90 days from any time = **daily** data (00:00 UTC)
  * Cache / Update Frequency:\
    Based on days range (all the API plans)
    * 1 day = 30 seconds cache
    * 2 -90 days = 30 minutes cache
    * 90 days = 12 hours cache
  * The last completed UTC day (00:00) is available 35 minutes after midnight on the next UTC day (00:35). The cache will always expire at 00:40 UTC.
  * Access to historical data via the Public API (Demo plan) is **restricted to the past 365 days** only. To access the complete range of historical data, please subscribe to one of our [paid plans](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) to obtain a Pro-API key.
