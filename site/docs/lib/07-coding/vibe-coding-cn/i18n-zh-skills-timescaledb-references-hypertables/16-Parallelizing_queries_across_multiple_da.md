### Parallelizing queries across multiple data nodes

In a distributed hypertable, space partitioning enables inserts to be
parallelized across data nodes, even while the inserted rows share
timestamps from the same time interval, and thus increases the ingest rate.
Query performance also benefits by being able to parallelize queries
across nodes, particularly when full or partial aggregations can be
"pushed down" to data nodes (for example, as in the query
`avg(temperature) FROM conditions GROUP BY hour, location`
when using `location` as a space partition). Please see our
[best practices about partitioning in distributed hypertables][distributed-hypertable-partitioning-best-practices]
for more information.
