## Contribute to TimescaleDB Toolkit

We want and need your feedback! What are the frustrating parts of analyzing
time-series data? What takes far more code than you feel it should? What runs
slowly, or only runs quickly after many rewrites? We want to solve
community-wide problems and incorporate as much feedback as possible.

*   Join the [discussion][gh-discussions].
*   Check out the [proposed features][gh-proposed].
*   Explore the current [feature requests][gh-requests].
*   Add your own [feature request][gh-newissue].

**Examples:**

Example 1 (SQL):
```SQL
SELECT device id,
sum(abs_delta) as volatility
FROM (
 SELECT device_id,
abs(val - lag(val) OVER last_day) as abs_delta
FROM measurements
WHERE ts >= now()-'1 day'::interval) calc_delta
GROUP BY device_id;
```

Example 2 (SQL):
```SQL
SELECT device_id,
 timevector(ts, val) -> sort() -> delta() -> abs() -> sum() as volatility
FROM measurements
WHERE ts >= now()-'1 day'::interval
GROUP BY device_id;
```
