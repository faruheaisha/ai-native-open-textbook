# Video Generation with AI Gateway

> Original article: [Video Generation with AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/blog/video-generation-with-ai-gateway) by Jerilyn Zheng

## Why Video Generation in AI Gateway?

Video generation has rapidly evolved from a research curiosity to a production capability. By 2026, multiple providers offer APIs for generating high-quality video from text prompts, image references, and existing footage. But like the early days of LLM APIs, each provider has its own SDK, authentication scheme, response format, and pricing model.

Vercel's AI Gateway solves this the same way it solved LLM provider fragmentation: **a unified API that abstracts provider differences** while giving developers fine-grained control over quality, cost, and performance. Write your video generation code once, and switch between providers—or use multiple providers simultaneously—without changing your application code.

## AI SDK 6 Integration

AI SDK 6 introduces first-class video generation primitives that mirror the patterns developers already use for text and image generation:

### `generateVideo`

The synchronous API for short-form video generation:

```typescript
import { generateVideo } from 'ai';
import { gateway } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';

const result = await generateVideo({
  model: gateway('video-model'),
  prompt: 'A product demo showing a user navigating a dashboard app',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
  duration: 10,
});
```

### `streamVideo`

For longer-form content or real-time preview, the streaming API provides progressive output:

```typescript
import { streamVideo } from 'ai';
import { gateway } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';

const stream = streamVideo({
  model: gateway('video-model'),
  prompt: 'An educational walkthrough of setting up a Next.js project',
  aspectRatio: '16:9',
  duration: 60,
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  // Progressive frames or segments
  await processVideoChunk(chunk);
}
```

The API design follows the same patterns as `generateText` and `streamText`, making it immediately familiar to existing AI SDK users.

## Supported Providers and Models

AI Gateway provides access to multiple video generation providers through a single interface:

- **High-fidelity models**: For cinematic quality, marketing content, and polished output
- **Fast models**: For previews, prototyping, and real-time applications
- **Specialized models**: For specific use cases like screen recording enhancement, talking head generation, or animation

Provider selection can be automatic (Gateway chooses based on your quality/speed requirements) or explicit (you specify the exact model). The Gateway handles authentication, request formatting, and response normalization for each provider.

## Key Features

### Character Consistency

One of the hardest problems in video generation is maintaining character appearance across multiple shots or scenes. AI Gateway addresses this with reference-based generation:

```typescript
const result = await generateVideo({
  model: gateway('video-model'),
  prompt: 'The character explains a feature while pointing at a whiteboard',
  characterRef: previousScene.characterEmbedding,
  styleRef: brandStyleGuide,
});
```

By passing character embeddings between generation calls, you maintain visual consistency throughout a multi-scene video without manual intervention.

### Audio Synchronization

Generated video often needs synchronized audio—narration, sound effects, or background music. AI Gateway supports multi-modal generation:

```typescript
const result = await generateVideo({
  model: gateway('video-model'),
  prompt: 'Product walkthrough with narration',
  audio: {
    narration: 'Welcome to our new dashboard. Let me show you...',
    voice: 'professional-female',
    music: 'subtle-corporate',
  },
});
```

The audio is synchronized with the visual content at generation time, not stitched on afterward. This produces significantly more natural results—lip sync matches narration, sound effects align with on-screen actions, and music transitions follow scene changes.

### Style Transfer

Apply a consistent visual style across all generated content:

```typescript
const result = await generateVideo({
  model: gateway('video-model'),
  prompt: 'Team collaboration scene in a modern office',
  style: {
    reference: './brand-style.png',
    colorPalette: 'brand-colors',
    mood: 'professional-warm',
  },
});
```

This ensures brand consistency across a library of generated videos without per-prompt style instructions.

## Streaming Patterns for Video

Video streaming requires different patterns than text streaming:

- **Segment-based streaming**: Video arrives in playable segments (typically 2-5 seconds each) that can be displayed progressively
- **Preview streaming**: Low-resolution previews arrive first, with high-resolution segments following, enabling quick visual validation
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with a low-quality pass, then enhance to final quality. Users can abort early if the direction is wrong, saving cost

These patterns are particularly important for interactive applications where a user needs to review and approve generated content before it's published.

## Cost and Performance Considerations

Video generation is significantly more expensive than text or image generation. Practical cost management strategies include:

- **Preview before commit**: Generate a low-resolution preview first. Only upgrade to full quality after approval.
- **Duration optimization**: Generate only what you need. A 5-second product shot is cheaper than a 30-second scene.
- **Caching**: AI Gateway caches identical requests. If you're generating the same intro sequence repeatedly, it's served from cache.
- **Batch processing**: Queue non-urgent generations for off-peak pricing where providers offer it.

Performance varies significantly by model and output quality:

- **Fast models**: 10-30 seconds for a 10-second clip at 720p
- **High-quality models**: 2-5 minutes for a 10-second clip at 1080p with audio sync
- **Cinematic models**: 10-30 minutes for complex scenes with character consistency

## Use Cases

### Marketing Content

Generate product demos, social media clips, and promotional videos at scale. Character consistency and brand style transfer make it practical to create a coherent content library without a video production team.

### Product Demos

Create walkthroughs and feature demonstrations from text descriptions. Particularly powerful when combined with screen recording inputs—start with a real screen recording and have AI enhance it with narration, annotations, and transitions.

### Educational Material

Generate instructional videos, visual explanations, and tutorial content. The streaming API enables interactive educational experiences where content is generated in response to student questions.

### Personalized Content

Create per-user or per-segment video content. A SaaS onboarding flow could generate a personalized welcome video that references the user's specific product configuration.

## Practical Tips

1. **Start with text**: Write a detailed script before generating video. The better your text prompt, the better your output—just like with LLMs.
2. **Use reference images**: When possible, provide visual references for style, characters, and settings. Reference-based generation is more controllable than text-only.
3. **Iterate on short clips**: Test your prompts and settings on 3-5 second clips before generating full-length content.
4. **Plan for post-processing**: AI-generated video often benefits from light editing—trimming, color correction, and audio leveling. Build this into your workflow.
5. **Monitor costs**: Set budget alerts in AI Gateway. Video generation costs can accumulate quickly, especially during development when you're iterating on prompts.
6. **Cache aggressively**: If any part of your video content is reusable (intros, outros, transitions), generate it once and compose it with dynamic content.

## Looking Ahead

Video generation through AI Gateway represents the next frontier of AI-powered content creation. As models improve and costs decrease, the gap between "AI-generated" and "professionally produced" video will continue to narrow. Vercel's unified API approach ensures that developers can adopt new models and providers as they emerge, without rewriting their application code.
