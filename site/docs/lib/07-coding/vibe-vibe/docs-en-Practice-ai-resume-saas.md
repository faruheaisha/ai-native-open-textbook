# Full-Stack AI Resume Optimization SaaS

> Author: Luochen · Target audience: developers who have completed the basic and advanced tutorial sections.
> Timeline: approximately 1 week from concept to deployed MVP.

## Why Resume Optimization?

Before writing a single line of code, let's talk about why this market is worth building for.

### Market Validation

The numbers tell a compelling story:

- **$1.6 billion** — global resume builder market size in 2024
- **$3.1 billion** — projected market size by 2032
- **Rezi.ai** — 3.3 million users and growing
- **Teal HQ** — raised $20.7 million in funding

These aren't speculative "maybe AI will be useful here" numbers. People are already paying for resume help, and the market is doubling in under a decade. The question isn't whether there's demand — it's whether you can build something differentiated.

### What Makes AI Resume Optimization Different?

Most resume tools do surface-level formatting. An AI-powered optimizer can go deeper: analyzing job descriptions, identifying keyword gaps, scoring relevance, and suggesting concrete improvements. That's the product we're building.

## Phase 1: Requirements — Defining the MVP

### Using the JTBD Framework

The Jobs-To-Be-Done framework helps us understand what users actually need. The key insight:

> **Users don't want a "better resume." They want interviews.**

This reframes everything. Grammar fixes and formatting are nice, but they're not what users will pay for. Users want to know:

1. How well does my resume match this specific job?
2. What keywords am I missing?
3. What should I change to get past ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)?
4. How do I present my experience to match what this employer wants?

### Strip to Core MVP

Starting from the JTBD insight, here's what our MVP includes — and what it doesn't:

**In scope (MVP):**
- Paste resume text + target job description
- AI analysis: match score, missing keywords, section-by-section feedback
- AI-optimized resume output
- Streaming response for real-time feedback

**Out of scope (future iterations):**
- User accounts and saved resumes
- PDF upload/parsing
- Multiple resume versions
- Payment processing
- Job board integration

The goal is to prove the core value proposition — AI can meaningfully improve your resume for a specific job — in the simplest possible form.

## Phase 2: Prompt Engineering

The AI prompt is the heart of this product. Get it right, and the optimization feels magical. Get it wrong, and it's just another chatbot.

### Designing the System Prompt

We want the AI to act as a **senior technical recruiter** — someone who has reviewed thousands of resumes and knows exactly what hiring managers and ATS systems look for.

Here's the core prompt structure:

```
You are a senior technical recruiter with 15 years of experience
reviewing resumes for top tech companies.

Given a resume and a target job description, provide:

1. **Match Score** (0-100): How well the resume matches the job
2. **Missing Keywords**: Critical terms from the job description
   that are absent from the resume
3. **Section Analysis**: For each resume section (Summary,
   Experience, Skills, Education), provide specific feedback
4. **Optimized Content**: A rewritten version of the resume
   optimized for this specific job

Output format: JSON with the following structure:
{
  "score": number,
  "missingKeywords": string[],
  "analysis": {
    "summary": string,
    "experience": string,
    "skills": string,
    "education": string
  },
  "optimizedContent": string
}

Rules:
- Never invent experience the candidate doesn't have
- Focus on rephrasing and reorganizing existing experience
- Prioritize ATS compatibility
- Be specific in feedback — "add more metrics" is too vague,
  "quantify the user growth you drove in Q3" is actionable
```

### Choosing the Model

For this project, we'll use the **Moonshot v1-8k** model (via Kimi K2), but the architecture supports swapping to any OpenAI-compatible API. Key considerations:

- **Context window**: 8K tokens is sufficient for most resumes + job descriptions
- **JSON output**: The model reliably produces structured JSON when instructed
- **Cost**: Significantly cheaper than GPT-4 for high-volume usage
- **Speed**: Fast enough for streaming responses

### Testing the Prompt

Before building the app, test your prompt extensively:

1. Try it with different resume formats (technical, creative, executive)
2. Test with various job descriptions (startups, enterprise, different roles)
3. Verify the JSON output is consistently parseable
4. Check that it never fabricates experience

Prompt iteration is cheap. Ship the prompt when it works reliably across at least 10-15 diverse test cases.

## Phase 3: Full-Stack Implementation

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) | Full-stack in one project |
| UI | Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS | Professional components, fast styling |
| AI Integration | Vercel AI SDK (`streamText`) | First-class streaming support |
| API Route | `/api/optimize` | Server-side API key protection |
| Model | moonshot-v1-8k | Cost-effective, reliable JSON output |
| Deployment | Vercel | Zero-config Next.js hosting |

### Project Setup

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ai-resume-optimizer
cd ai-resume-optimizer

# Install dependencies
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Building the Frontend

The UI has three states:

**State 1: Input**
- Two large text areas: "Your Resume" and "Job Description"
- A prominent "Optimize My Resume" button
- Clean, professional design — this is a career tool, not a toy

**State 2: Analyzing**
- Streaming response displayed in real-time
- Users see the AI "thinking" — this builds trust and engagement
- Progress indication for each analysis section

**State 3: Results**
- Match score displayed prominently (with color coding: red/yellow/green)
- Missing keywords as clickable tags
- Section-by-section analysis in expandable cards
- Optimized resume in a copyable text block
- "Optimize Again" button to iterate

Prompt your AI assistant:

```
Create the main page at src/app/page.tsx for an AI resume optimizer.
Use Shadcn UI components (Card, Button, Textarea, Badge, Progress).

The page should have:
1. A hero section with the app title and value proposition
2. Two side-by-side textareas: "Your Resume" and "Target Job Description"
3. An "Optimize" button that's disabled when either textarea is empty
4. A results section that appears after optimization, showing:
   - A circular score indicator (0-100)
   - Missing keywords as badges
   - Section feedback in cards
   - The optimized resume in a copyable block
5. Use Vercel AI SDK's useChat or useCompletion for streaming
```

### Building the API Route

The backend is a single API route that orchestrates the AI call:

```
Create src/app/api/optimize/route.ts that:

1. Accepts POST with { resume: string, jobDescription: string }
2. Validates both fields are non-empty
3. Constructs the system prompt for resume analysis
4. Uses Vercel AI SDK's streamText() to stream the response
5. Uses the moonshot-v1-8k model (OpenAI-compatible API)
6. Returns the streaming response

The API key should come from process.env.MOONSHOT_API_KEY.
Include rate limiting: max 5 requests per minute per IP.
```

### Handling the Streaming Response

The streaming experience is crucial for user engagement. Without it, users stare at a loading spinner for 15-30 seconds, which feels broken. With streaming, they see the analysis building in real-time, which feels fast and impressive.

The Vercel AI SDK makes this straightforward:

```typescript
// Simplified example of the streaming pattern
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const moonshot = createOpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.moonshot.cn/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.MOONSHOT_API_KEY,
});

const result = streamText({
  model: moonshot('moonshot-v1-8k'),
  system: SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  prompt: `Resume:\n${resume}\n\nJob Description:\n${jobDescription}`,
});

return result.toDataStreamResponse();
```

### Rendering Markdown Output

The AI's analysis contains formatted text — bullet points, bold text, headers. Use `react-markdown` to render it properly:

```bash
npm install react-markdown
```

Apply Tailwind's `prose` class for beautiful typography:

```tsx
<div className="prose prose-sm max-w-none">
  <ReactMarkdown>{analysisText}</ReactMarkdown>
</div>
```

## Phase 4: Product Thinking

Building the feature is only half the battle. Making it feel like a product is the other half.

### The "Aha Moment"

The moment a user sees their match score and specific gaps, they understand the value instantly. This is the "aha moment" — and everything in the UI should be designed to reach it as fast as possible.

Design decisions that accelerate the aha moment:

- **No sign-up required** for the first optimization
- **Score appears first** in the streaming response (before detailed analysis)
- **Missing keywords are visual** — colored badges, not buried in text
- **Before/after comparison** — show the original and optimized versions side by side

### Tracking Engagement

Even for an MVP, track basic metrics:

- How many optimizations are run per day?
- What percentage of users run a second optimization?
- Do users copy the optimized resume?
- Where do users drop off?

These metrics tell you whether the product is working before you invest in advanced features.

### Freemium Model

A natural monetization path:

| Tier | Includes | Price |
|---|---|---|
| Free | 3 optimizations/day | $0 |
| Pro | Unlimited + PDF export + saved history | $9.99/month |
| Team | Multi-user + analytics | $29.99/month |

Start with free-only to validate demand, then add payment when you have consistent daily active users.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Privacy: Anonymize Before API Calls

Resumes contain sensitive personal information — names, phone numbers, addresses, employer names. Before sending resume text to any AI API:

- Strip or replace personally identifiable information
- Use placeholder names in the prompt if needed
- Make your privacy policy clear to users
- Consider offering a local/self-hosted option for privacy-conscious users

::: warning Data Privacy Matters
Resume data is inherently sensitive. Even if you trust your AI provider, your users need to trust you. Be transparent about what data you send, where it goes, and how long it's retained.
:::

### Hallucination: Never Invent Experience

The biggest risk in AI resume optimization is the AI fabricating experience the candidate doesn't have. Your system prompt must explicitly forbid this:

- "Never add experience, skills, or achievements not present in the original resume"
- "Rephrase and reorganize — never invent"
- Validate the output: if the optimized resume mentions a skill not in the original, flag it

### Formatting: Markdown + Prose

Raw AI output looks terrible in a web UI. Always render through a markdown processor with proper styling. The `react-markdown` + Tailwind `prose` combination handles 95% of formatting needs.

### Deployment: Environment Variables

A classic beginner mistake: your app works locally but crashes in production because the API key isn't set.

**Checklist before deploying:**
- [ ] Add `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` (or your chosen provider's key) in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Verify the API key works in production (not just locally)
- [ ] Set up error handling for missing/invalid API keys
- [ ] Test the full flow on the deployed URL

## Wrapping Up

In about a week, you've built a product that:

1. Solves a real problem (resume optimization for specific jobs)
2. Uses AI meaningfully (not just as a gimmick)
3. Has a clear monetization path
4. Is deployed and accessible to real users

The key insight from this project: **start with the user's job-to-be-done, not with the technology.** AI is the how, not the why. The "why" is that people want interviews, and a well-optimized resume gets them there.
