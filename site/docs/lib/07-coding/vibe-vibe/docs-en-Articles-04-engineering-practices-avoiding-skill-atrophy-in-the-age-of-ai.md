# Avoiding Skill Atrophy in the Age of AI

> Original article: [Avoiding Skill Atrophy in the Age of AI](https://addyo.substack.com/p/avoiding-skill-atrophy-in-the-age) by Addy Osmani

## The "Use It or Lose It" Problem

There's a paradox at the heart of AI-assisted development: the better AI tools get at writing code, the less practice developers get at writing code themselves. And skills that aren't practiced deteriorate.

This isn't hypothetical. Cognitive science has a clear model for skill atrophy: when you stop practicing a skill, the neural pathways that support it weaken over time. The skill doesn't disappear overnight—it erodes gradually, often without you noticing until you need it and it's not there.

For developers who rely heavily on AI assistants, the risk is real. If the AI writes all your code, debugs all your errors, and designs all your architectures, what happens to your ability to do those things independently?

## How Skill Atrophy Works

The cycle is straightforward and self-reinforcing:

1. **Less practice**: AI handles tasks you used to do manually.
2. **Less competence**: Your ability to perform those tasks independently declines.
3. **More dependence**: As your skills weaken, you rely on AI even more.
4. **Even less practice**: The cycle accelerates.

This isn't a reason to reject AI tools—they're genuinely valuable. But it is a reason to be intentional about which skills you maintain and how you maintain them.

## Skills at Risk

Not all engineering skills are equally vulnerable. Here are the areas most at risk of atrophy:

### Debugging

Debugging is perhaps the most endangered skill. AI can often identify and fix bugs faster than manual debugging. But when the AI can't figure it out—and it won't always be able to—you need deep debugging skills: reading stack traces, forming hypotheses, isolating variables, using debuggers, and reasoning about state.

### System Design

When AI generates code component by component, it's easy to lose sight of the big picture. System design—how components interact, where to draw boundaries, how data flows through the system—requires holistic thinking that AI assists but doesn't replace.

### Problem Decomposition

Breaking a complex problem into manageable pieces is a foundational skill. If you always throw the whole problem at an AI and accept whatever comes back, you lose the ability to decompose problems yourself. This matters because problem decomposition is also how you evaluate whether the AI's approach is good.

### Low-Level Understanding

Understanding how things work under the hood—memory management, network protocols, database query plans, browser rendering pipelines—gives you the ability to reason about performance and correctness at a fundamental level. AI abstraction can erode this understanding.

### Code Reading

If AI writes most of your code, you might spend less time reading other people's code—which is how you learn patterns, idioms, and architectural approaches. Code reading is a skill that compounds over time, and it atrophies when neglected.

## Deliberate Practice Strategies

The solution isn't to stop using AI. It's to practice deliberately, the same way an athlete maintains fitness even when technology handles the heavy lifting.

### Code Without AI Weekly

Set aside regular time to write code without any AI assistance. This could be a side project, a coding challenge, or even a feature at work that you intentionally implement manually. The goal isn't efficiency—it's maintaining your ability to solve problems from scratch.

### Review All AI Output Thoroughly

Don't just glance at AI-generated code and merge it. Read every line. Ask yourself: "Could I have written this? Do I understand why it works? Could I modify it if requirements changed?" If the answer to any of these is no, stop and learn before proceeding.

### Teach Others

Teaching is one of the most effective ways to maintain and deepen understanding. Explain a concept to a junior developer, write a blog post, or create documentation. If you can't explain it, you don't understand it well enough—and that's a signal to study more.

### Do Periodic Deep Dives

Pick a technology you use daily and go deep. Read the source code. Understand the internals. Build a toy version from scratch. This kind of deep understanding is what separates a developer who uses a framework from one who masters it.

## Building T-Shaped Skills

The concept of T-shaped skills is especially relevant in the AI era:

- **The vertical bar**: Deep expertise in your core area. This is the skill set that makes you irreplaceable. Maintain it through deliberate practice, even when AI can handle the routine work.
- **The horizontal bar**: Broad familiarity with adjacent areas. AI makes it easier to work across domains, but surface-level familiarity isn't enough. You need enough depth to evaluate AI output in these areas.

The ideal AI-era developer has deep expertise in their core domain and enough breadth to effectively direct and evaluate AI across related domains.

## Understanding Before Delegating

A critical principle: **understand it before you delegate it to AI**. If you've never written a database migration by hand, you won't be able to evaluate whether the AI's migration is correct. If you've never debugged a memory leak, you won't know when the AI's "fix" is actually a band-aid.

This doesn't mean you need to do everything manually first. It means you need enough understanding to be a competent evaluator. Think of it like managing a team: you don't need to be able to do every team member's job, but you need to understand it well enough to evaluate their work.

## Maintaining Debugging Skills

Debugging deserves special attention because it's the skill most likely to save you when things go wrong—and things always go wrong eventually.

Practical ways to maintain debugging skills:

- When a bug appears, try to diagnose it yourself before asking AI.
- Practice reading error messages and stack traces without AI translation.
- Use debugging tools (browser DevTools, debuggers, profilers) regularly.
- When AI fixes a bug, make sure you understand the root cause, not just the fix.
- Occasionally debug by reading code instead of using tools—this builds your mental model of the system.

## The Gym Analogy

Here's a useful metaphor: **AI is like a forklift**. It's fantastic for moving heavy things. No one would question using a forklift to move a pallet of bricks. But if you use the forklift for everything—including walking to the break room—your legs will atrophy.

You still need to stay physically fit, even if you have a forklift. Similarly, you still need to maintain your engineering skills, even if you have AI. The forklift handles the heavy lifting; your fitness handles everything else—including knowing when and how to operate the forklift effectively.

The developers who will thrive in the AI era aren't the ones who use AI the most or the least. They're the ones who use AI strategically while maintaining the foundational skills that make them effective engineers—with or without AI.

Stay fit. Use the forklift. But never stop going to the gym.
