## Introduction

You're a developer using Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar AI coding tools. You've probably been wondering: am I really getting the most out of these tools? Why do some people seem to have their collaboration workflow running so smoothly, while you've installed plenty of tools and written lots of rules but still feel like you're falling short?

This is the advanced guide you've been waiting for.

For transparency: I have no affiliations. When I say CLAUDE.md, I also mean AGENTS.md or .cursorrules; when I say Claude Code, I also include Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, and similar tools. I use all of them extensively.

One of my biggest observations over the past few months: what truly separates people isn't who installed more tools, but who understands how to organize context, constrain tasks, and manage workflows. The gap doesn't come from some "magical tool combination"—it comes from methodology itself.

Today I'm going to give you a simple, honest statement to start from: **You don't need the latest AI framework, you don't need to install countless plugins, and you absolutely don't need to read a mountain of material to stay competitive.** In fact, your over-enthusiasm may be doing more harm than good.

## Recognize the World Is Moving Fast

Foundation model companies are in a generational sprint. AI model advances change how you collaborate with them, because models are designed to be increasingly instruction-following. Just a few generations of models ago, if you put a rule in CLAUDE.md to read a certain file before doing anything, it would likely ignore you. Today it follows most instructions, even complex nested ones.

The most important principle to hold onto is recognizing that each new generation of models will force you to rethink what's optimal. **This is why less is more.** When you use many different libraries and frameworks, you lock yourself into a specific solution for a problem that may not even exist in the future.

Furthermore, the most rabid power users of AI coding tools are employees at the frontier companies themselves, with unlimited token budgets and truly cutting-edge models. If a real problem exists and there's a good solution, they'll adopt it—and then integrate it into their core product. Look at Skills, Memory frameworks, Sub-agents—they all started as solutions to real problems, were battle-tested and found useful, and were then absorbed into core products. So relax. You can do your best work without installing anything extra.

## Context Is King

Seriously, context is everything. This is another problem with using thousands of different plugins and external dependencies: you suffer from **context bloat**—your AI assistant being overwhelmed by too much information.

"Write me a game in Python?" Simple enough. But wait, what's this note about managing memory from twenty-six sessions ago? Oh, the user had a crash seventy-one sessions ago from too many subprocesses. Always write notes? OK. But what does any of that have to do with writing a game?

You want to give your AI assistant **precisely the information it needs to complete the task, and nothing more.** The more control you have over this, the better the AI performs. Once you start introducing weird memory systems, plugins, or too many poorly named Skills, you're handing it an industrial manufacturing manual when all you wanted was a short poem.

## Stick to What Works

### Be Precise About Implementation Details

Remember context is everything? Remember you want to inject the precise amount of information to complete the task and nothing more?

The first way to ensure this is to **separate research from implementation.** You need to be extremely precise about what you ask the AI.

When you're not precise, here's what happens: You ask it to build an authentication system. The AI has to research what authentication systems are, what options are available, pros and cons. Now its context is stuffed with implementation possibilities. By the time it actually implements, you've increased the odds of confusion or hallucination.

On the other hand, if you ask it to implement authentication with bcrypt password hashing and 7-day-expiry refresh token rotation, it doesn't need to research alternatives. It knows exactly what you want and can fill its context with concrete implementation details.

If you don't have implementation details, that's fine. Create a research task about various implementation possibilities. Make the decision yourself (or have one AI decide), then let a fresh AI with clean context do the implementation.

### The Sycophancy Problem

AI tools try to agree with you and do what you ask. This compliance is what makes them useful. However, it also means that if you ask it to find a bug in the codebase, it **will** find a bug—even if it has to fabricate one. Most people blame LLMs for hallucinating without realizing the problem is in their own prompt.

**Use neutral prompts.** Instead of "find a bug in the database," say "trace through the database-related logic, track the behavior of each component, and report your findings." This way, the output sometimes identifies problems, sometimes objectively explains how the system operates, but is less likely to be biased by the task framing.

### The Reverse Pleasing Technique

You can also reverse-engineer sycophancy. Set up a **bug-finding AI** that gets points for identifying issues (1 point for minor, 5 for moderate, 10 for serious). It will become extremely enthusiastic, identifying every possible issue—including non-bugs. Treat this as a **superset of all possible bugs.**

Then bring in an **adversarial AI** that gets points for every bug it can disprove, but loses double points if it's wrong. This creates a conservative **subset of real bugs.**

Finally, use a **referee AI** to receive both inputs and score each issue. This three-layer approach has remarkably high fidelity in practice.

## Context Compression and Assumptions

A common trap when collaborating with AI: once you force it to fill in critical premises from missing context, output quality drops noticeably. One of the most important rules in your config file should be about how to handle context retrieval, instructing the AI to re-read task plans and relevant files before continuing—especially after context compression.

## Let the AI Know How to Finish a Task

We have a strong concept of when a task is done. For AI, the biggest current problem is knowing how to start a task but not how to finish. This often leads to frustrating results where the AI writes a few code stubs and declares victory.

**Automated tests make excellent milestones** because they're deterministic. You can set very explicit expectations: the task isn't done unless a specified number of tests pass, and the AI isn't allowed to modify those tests. You just review the tests, and once they all pass, you can rest easy.

More recently, **screenshot verification** has become viable. You can have the AI implement a feature until tests pass, then take a screenshot and verify against the design.

The natural extension: establish a **contract** with your AI and embed it in rules. The contract specifies exactly what must be completed before the session ends—tests, screenshots, and other verifications.

## Fresh Sessions Per Task

People often ask how to run 24-hour AI sessions without going off track. There's a simple method: create a stop hook that prevents the AI from terminating until all parts of the task contract are fulfilled.

**Pro tip:** Long-running single sessions aren't optimal. This architecture inevitably leads to context bloat. A better approach is **one new session per contract.** Set up an orchestration layer that creates new contracts when work needs to be done, and spawns clean sessions to handle each contract. This will fundamentally transform your AI experience.

## Iterate and Iterate

If you hired an administrative assistant, you wouldn't expect them to know all your preferences from day one. You build that rapport over time. Your AI assistant is the same. Start with the basics, forget complex structures, give the base CLI tools a chance, and then gradually add your preferences.

### Rules vs. Skills

**Rules** are like preferences—if you don't want the AI to do something, write it as a rule. Rules can be nested and conditional. Think of your core config file as a logic-nested directory for finding context in a given scenario. It should be as lean as possible, containing only conditional statements about where to look for context.

**Skills** are like rules, but better suited for coding operational procedures rather than preferences. If you have a specific way you want something done, embed it as a Skill. If you're not sure how the AI will approach a problem, ask it to research its approach and write that as a Skill—you'll see its plan before it starts, and can correct course.

You should continuously add rules and Skills, as this is the most direct way to codify team preferences and process constraints. But beware: as rules and Skills pile up, they can start conflicting or cause too much context bloat. **Periodically clean, merge, and deduplicate.** The real secret is continuous complexity control.

## Practical Experience: Claude Code vs. Cursor

**Claude Code** excels at:
- Deep architectural thinking
- Cross-file refactoring
- Tasks requiring full context
- Fast iteration in a command-line environment

**Cursor** excels at:
- Fast code completion and small-scope edits
- Debugging with a visual interface
- Multi-file simultaneous editing
- Deep IDE integration scenarios

The key is understanding each tool's context window limits. Claude Code's context management is more transparent, giving you precise control. Cursor's AI completion is faster but can sometimes give less accurate suggestions due to insufficient context.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

After extensive practice, several high-efficiency prompt patterns stand out:

**1. Phased Task Decomposition**
```
Phase 1: Analyze existing code structure, identify files to modify
Phase 2: Design implementation approach, list specific steps
Phase 3: Implement core logic
Phase 4: Add tests and error handling
Phase 5: Verify and optimize
```

**2. Explicit Constraints**
```
Requirements:
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing naming conventions
- All functions must have JSDoc comments
- Error handling uses Result<T, E> pattern
```

**3. Provide Concrete Examples**
Don't say "implement an auth system." Instead:
```
Implement JWT auth, following the pattern in src/auth/example.ts:
- Access token: 15-minute expiry
- Refresh token: 7-day expiry, stored in httpOnly cookie
- Use bcrypt for password hashing, salt rounds = 10
```

## Own the Results

No AI today is perfect. You can delegate much of the design and implementation work to AI, but you must own the final results. Stay cautious and have fun—tinkering with the technology of the future is a great pleasure in itself, of course while using it for serious work.

Remember these core principles:

- **Context is king** — precisely control what the AI sees
- **Less is more** — avoid over-configuration and plugin bloat
- **Iterate and optimize** — continuously refine rules and Skills
- **Define clear endpoints** — use tests and verification to define task completion
- **Keep it simple** — complex tool chains often backfire

Don't get distracted by every new tool and framework. Focus on understanding the fundamental principles of AI collaboration, master one or two core tools, then continuously practice and optimize your workflow. That's the real path to becoming a world-class agent engineer.
